~ Egocentric bias
- {*Tendency*} to claim more responsibility for themselves for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would. Recalling the past in a self-serving manner. Like remembering one's exam grades as being better than they were.

~ False consensus effect
- {*Tendency*} for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them.

~ List-length effect
- A smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well.

~ Overconfidence effect
- {*Tendency*} of being more certain than is justified, given your priors and the evidence available.
~ Part-list cueing effect
- That being shown some items from a list and later retrieving one item causes it to become harder to retrieve the other items.
~ Picture superiority effect

~ Positivity effect
- That older adults favor positive over negative information in their memories.
~ Primacy effect
- {*Tendency*} to weigh initial events more than subsequent events.
~ Processing effect
- That information that takes longer to read, and is processed with more difficulty, is more easily remembered.

~ Testing effect
- The fact that you more easily remember information you have read by rewriting it instead of rereading it.
~ Underconfidence effect
- State of being more uncertain than is justified, given your priors and the evidence you are aware of.

~ Von restorff effect
- {*Tendency*} to remember an item that "stands out like a sore thumb", more than other items.
~ Zeigarnik effect
- That uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones.
~ Focusing effect
- {*Tendency*} of placing too much importance on one aspect of an event; causes error in accurately predicting the utility of a future outcome.
~ Endowment effect

- {*Assumption*} that the way you see the world reflects the way the world really is.
~ Typical mind fallacy
- {*Assumption*} that other people are more like you than they actually are.
~ Fallacy of gray

- {*The Sophisticate*}: "The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else." {*The Zetet*}: "Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade.

~ Sunk cost fallacy
- Letting past investments interfere with decision-making in the present.
~ Giant cheesecake fallacy
- Occurs when an argument leaps directly from capability to actuality, without considering the necessary intermediate of motive.
~ Narrative fallacy
- A vulnerability to over-interpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths.
~ Scales of justice fallacy
- Error of using a simple polarized scheme for deciding a complex issue/ each piece of evidence about the question is individually categorized as supporting exactly one of the two opposing positions.
~ Top 1% fallacy
- Related to not taking into account the idea that a small sample size is not always reflective of a whole population and that sample populations with certain characteristics, e.g. made up of repeat job seekers, are not reflective of the whole population.
~ Fallacy of relative privation
- Error of thinking that if something is worse than the problem currently being discussed, then the problem currently being discussed isn't that important at all. In other words: nothing matters if it's not literally the worst thing happening

? Heuristics
~ Absurdity
- {*Mental shortcut*} where highly untypical situations are classified as absurd or impossible. 
~ Affect
- {*Mental shortcut*} basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation.
~ Availability
- {*Mental shortcut*} that treats easily recalled information as important or more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled.
