* FOREWORD
& This is less a personal guideline than the results of side-effects. It is {*not*} about achieving happiness, as I could not find correlations between happiness and productivity; productivity occured equally during low happiness and high happiness.
* PART A
& I have based my life toward two aspirations, {_Arts & Sciences_}. I have thus devised th my life to be aimed their sole acceleration. Analysis of {{personal statistics|Horaire}} revealed travel to be an important enabler for inspiration, and so I have steered my work toward facilitating opportunities to travel. A step away from {_Arts & Sciences_} was then, a step backward.
? Optimizing toward more income showed less progress than optimizing toward the need for less revenue.
& School was forcing me into multi-tasking, which revealed itself to have a negative impact to the creation of {_Arts & Sciences_}. Working within the confines of a single medium, would invoke long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period exceeding multiple years showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad - showed an improvement in the realization of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
& Automating work always returned higher reward than any attempt at brute force. The least amount of acting required for any one task, the better. Over a period of time, building {{specific tools|Gamme}} mostly returned higher performance than learning general purpose tools.
* PART B
& Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always gave a positive outcome, against acting randomly which made possible taking accidental steps away from the goals.
& I have kept daily logs on personal {_productivity output_} & {_creative input_}, and graphed this data to predict, and steer, creativity patterns. Each day has the completion of a singular task & a singular medium assigned. The output portion of the day(programming, designing, composing), ends with the completion of the task, whereas the remaining time is spent on input(reading, watching, listening).
? The purpose of this discipline is to limit multi-tasking.
& When a day ends before its assigned task is complete, the day was a planning failure; the task is then divided into smaller tasks, each assigned to a day. When the day ends too early after the completion of the one task, the day was also a planning failure.
* PART C
& I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a {_task to complete_} & and a {_lesson to learn_}, and I do not go to sleep until I have logged the results.
& In the following order, I first address the problems that slow me down, the questions that occupy the idle mind, and the things I find lacking in life.
