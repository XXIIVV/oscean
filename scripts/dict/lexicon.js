    * Gameplay
    & This is a multiplayer typing tactics game where you incarnate an animal summoner. You must type, quickly and intelligently, sequences of animal names to counter and destroy your opponent.
    & The game will {_most likely_} let you summon any animal you can think of, choose wisely for each animal has it's own speed, power and intelligence stats.
    * Multiplayer
    & By typing {*LOCAL*} in the login you will then find yourself battling the computer and possibly discover new animals. But the real fun begins by challenging other human summoners
    & If you wish to start your own arena, type {*HOST RABBIT*} in the splash screen input. This will initiate an arena called "rabbit" and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN RABBIT*} - you don't have to pick rabbit as game name.
    & If you want to create a nameless match, simply type {*HOST*}, without a game name, and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN*} and by typing your IP Address if the other player is on the same local network.
    & To join a game over the internet, you can type {*JOIN RABBIT*} to connect to the game named "rabbit" or leave simply type {*JOIN*} to connect to a random game. If you wish to play local, you can simply type the host's IP.
    * Splash Commands</h2>
    & You can enter a few commands and cheat codes into the splash field.
    # Local  > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Play against an AI summonerJoin   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Battle a random internet summoner       > Game Name  : Challenge a specific internet summoner       > IP Address : Challenge a local(LAN) summonerHost   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Create a LAN/Internet game       > Game Name  : Create a LAN/Internet game with a specific nameMute   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    : Turn the music OFF
    & The game also has a few cheat codes that can be entered in the splash field, ask your friends for these codes maybe someone has found one.
    * Soundtrack
    & The sounds and sountrack of the game were composed by {{Aliceffekt}}. There is 4 versions of the BGM available in the game, some of them are secret tracks.
    & If you wish to turn off the sounds, type in {*MUTE*} in the login field. You might have heard something about cheatcodes, well, if you know any. They must be typed into the login screen.
    * Patch 1.1
    & A new version was released on june 15th 2012 including better online accessiblity, animal balancing and minor networking fixes.
    - You can now name your games and tell your friend to connect to it by name instead of IP! (IP still works, though)
    - Create a server and wait for a user, or join an anonymous server randomly!
    - Server no longer needs to forward port 10000
    - In local mode, AI opponent spawns more/less units per second depending on wins/losses
    - Options better presented, no more accidental enter key press
    - Escape key quits to splash

It will be presented at the {{IGDA|http://www.igda.org/montreal/Jan31_DemoNight}} tomorrow evening at the demo night and publicly playable for the first time at the next {{Indies Meetup|https://www.facebook.com/events/182113635223855/}} and {{Toy Company festival|http://toycompany.cc/}} in February.
    * Controls
    & You need two gamepads (so far the Xbox wired, wireless and a Logitech generic gamepad have been tested and work) to play, there are no keyboard control fallback (yet). The controls are pretty exotic. To move around you can press either the D-Pad (or left analog stick) or the face buttons (A/B/X/Y), and the direction of the button does the same input as if you pressed that D-Pad direction. As you move, your player will throw a punch, kick or flail his ears to make you move as a result.
    & To hit the other player, you need to get close to him by hitting away from him, then hit him by moving away from him. Ramming into the opponent just doesn't do it, you need to throw punches, and depending on the impact velocity, even that might not be enough. You can throw double-punches to make sure you land a solid hit and take off an item.

PICO BATTLE
  UNDE : Collegiennes
  BREF : {{Pico Battle}} is a colour-based multiplayer battle puzzler, in the style of {{Pico}}.
  LONG
    & {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and I showcased an experimental game at {*Prince of the Arcade*} last year but, between {{Volkenessen}}, {{Diluvium}} and {{Waiting for Horus}}, only got back to release it now. It is simply called Pico Battle and like our other {{Pico}} titled game - this game plays with colours; but this time, in multiplayer.
    & Unlike our last game, text heavy Diluvium, Pico Battle is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.
    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black & white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.
    & Pico Battle is an entirely wordless game, and might seem offputting or hard to grasp at first. In the lobby, a robotic voice will explain the basics of the game, and take your time there to experiment with the controls and the scarce UI elements. As you get familiar with the game and its interface, you will discover strategies and enjoy it even more.
    - AI now raises a random shield before you attack with any colour
    - Fixed graphical issue on arc-link shadows
    - Escape key now quits the game if pressed in the lobby

THE SARTRE MECHANISM
  UNDE : Notes
  BREF : It was just three days before Christmas when my friend invited me to his workshop to witness the completion of his latest project.
  LONG
    & Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine. His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.
    & What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be a beautiful clock; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.
    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    ? Perfect, in every way.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

THE BOOKS OF BABEL
  UNDE : Notes
  BREF : After ages of searching the endless isles of the {_Library Of Babel_}, here are a few interesting books that I have collected over the years.
  LONG
    & The {*Narration*} books, the narrated thoughts of the reader in the vein of "I sit down, pick up the thick volume and begin reading, I notice the words to be- Oh, I can read my own thoughts on the page".
    & Skipping lines to look ahead appears to already be acounted for and so, wherever one chooses to continue reading resumes the narration where it was left off. In this way, the book cannot be used to predict future thoughts, despite its content being already fully present and unchanging.
    & Some variances of these volumes read as dialogs between the reader's mental voice and that of other claimed interlocutor, possibly the book itself. Reading a line a second time hold but the account of past thoughts.
    & The {*Divination*} books are books that when to open to a previously unseen page, are said to answer a tought or another. Some of the books are used to regular purposes like to give a written out numerical answer to a mathematical question, or the location of a book or hexagon.
    & The {*Picture*} books contain pages where characters are the pixels of a digital picture. The {*Moving Picture*} books appear to display moving pictures when flicked through, where each page is a frame. This include the rare Mirror tomes that, like its name fortells, reflect the reader's features like a mirror would.
