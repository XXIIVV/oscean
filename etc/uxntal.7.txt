.SH NAME
uxntal \- assembly language for Varvara virtual machine
.SH DESCRIPTION
Uxntal is an 8-bit instruction set for programming the Varvara virtual machine.
It uses the lower 5-bits to specify an opcode, and the upper 3-bits to specify
optional modes.

ROMs consist of a 16-bit address space of bytes. Any byte can be interpreted as either data or an instruction. A 2-byte program counter (\fIpc\fP) determines the address of the next instruction to decode and run.

Instructions manipulate data using two stacks: a working stack (\fBwst\fP) and a return stack (\fBrst\fP). Each stack consists of 256 bytes, and in the case of overflow or underflow the stack pointer will wrap (the stacks are circular).

There are also 256 bytes of device memory, which are used to interact with the virtual machine and its devices.

Instructions deal with unsigned 8-bit values (\fIbytes\fP) and unsigned 16-bit values (\fIshorts\fP). There are no other built-in data types. Occasionally values are treated as signed, such as when loading, storing, or jumping with a relative address.

Short values are stored on the stack in big-endian byte order: the least significant byte will be on the top of the stack. This makes \fB#abcd\fB is equivalent to \fB#ab #cd\fB.

.SH OPCODE LAYOUT

There are 32 base values for opcodes:

    0x00 \fBBRK*\fP   0x08 \fBEQU\fP    0x10 \fBLDZ\fP    0x18 \fBADD\fP
    0x01 \fBINC\fP    0x09 \fBNEQ\fP    0x11 \fBSTZ\fP    0x19 \fBSUB\fP
    0x02 \fBPOP\fP    0x0a \fBGTH\fP    0x12 \fBLDR\fP    0x1a \fBMUL\fP
    0x03 \fBNIP\fP    0x0b \fBLTH\fP    0x13 \fBSTR\fP    0x1b \fBDIV\fP
    0x04 \fBSWP\fP    0x0c \fBJMP\fP    0x14 \fBLDA\fP    0x1c \fBAND\fP
    0x05 \fBROT\fP    0x0d \fBJCN\fP    0x15 \fBSTA\fP    0x1d \fBORA\fP
    0x06 \fBDUP\fP    0x0e \fBJSR\fP    0x16 \fBDEI\fP    0x1e \fBEOR\fP
    0x07 \fBOVR\fP    0x0f \fBSTH\fP    0x17 \fBDEO\fP    0x1f \fBSFT\fP

The "complete" opcode's value can be derived by combining the base value with its flags.

For example, \fBADD2k\fP is \fB(ADD | 2 | k)\fP = \fB(0x18 | 0x20 | 0x80)\fP = \fB0xb8\fP.

Unlike other opcodes, \fB0x00\fP (\fBBRK*\fP) is contextual: its meaning depends on the \fImode\fP bits provided:

    0x00 \fBBRK\fP    0x80 \fBLIT\fP
    0x20 \fBJCI\fP    0xa0 \fBLIT2\fP
    0x40 \fBJMI\fP    0xc0 \fBLITr\fP
    0x60 \fBJSI\fP    0xe0 \fBLIT2r\fP

.SH STACK EFFECTS

.BR

.SS NOTATION

Given a stack effect \fB( a^ b^ c^ -- c^ a^ b^ )\fP here is what each symbol means:

    \fB(\fP and \fB)\fP are comment delimiters
    \fBa^\fP, \fBb^\fP, and \fBc^\fP are values on the stack
    \fB^\fP indicates that each value is a \fIbyte\fP (\fB*\fP would indicate \fIshort\fP)
    \fB--\fP separates the "before" and "after" of the stack effect

The effect here is to move the top byte of the stack below the next two bytes, which could be achieved with \fBROT ROT\fP.

By default stack effects describe the effect on \fBwst\fP. When \fBrst\fP is involved we use \fB[]\fP to differentiate the stacks. For example \fB( a* [b*] -- a+1* [b+1*] )\fP will increment the top short of both \fBwst\fP and \fBrst\fP.

.SS EFFECTS AND MODES

Regular instructions have a single stack effect which is modified in a predictable way by any additional modes.

For example the generic effect for \fBADD\fP is ( x y -- x+y ). The eight combinations of modes have the following effects:

.nf

    \fBADD\fP    ( x^ y^   -- x+y^ )         sum bytes from \fBwst\fP
    \fBADDr\fP   ( [x^ y^] -- [x+y^] )       sum bytes from \fBrst\fP
    \fBADD2\fP   ( x* y*   -- x+y* )         sum shorts from \fBwst\fP
    \fBADD2r\fP  ( [x* y*] -- [x+y*] )       sum shorts from \fBrst\fP
    \fBADDk\fP   ( x^ y^   -- x^ y^ x+y^ )   sum and keep bytes from \fBwst\fP
    \fBADDkr\fP  ( [x^ y^] -- [x^ y^ x+y^] ) sum and keep bytes from \fBrst\fP
    \fBADD2k\fP  ( x* y*   -- x* y* x+y* )   sum and keep shorts from \fBwst\fP
    \fBADD2kr\fP ( [x* y*] -- [x* y* x+y*] ) sum and keep shorts from \fBrst\fP

.fi

Thus for regular instructions writing a "generic" effect (leaving sigils off values whose size depends on \fIshort mode\fP) is sufficient to describe its behavior across all eight variations. Note that some instructions always read values of a fixed size. For example the boolean condition read by \fBJCN\fP is always one byte, no matter what modes are used.

In \fIreturn mode\fP the stacks are reversed. Effects on \fBwst\fP will instead affect \fBrst\fP, and effects on \fBrst\fP will instead affect \fBwst\fP. For example, \fBSTH\fP reads a byte from \fBwst\fP and writes it to \fBrst\fP, but \fBSTHr\fP reads a byte from \fBrst\fP and writes it to \fBwst\fP.

In \fIkeep mode\fP all the values on the left-hand side of the stack effect will also appear on the right-hand side before the outputs. For example, \fBSWP\fP is \fB(x y -- y x)\fP but \fBSWPk\fP is \fB(x y -- x y y x)\fP.

.SS TERMINOLOGY

We consider the top of the stack to be the first value of the stack, and count back from there. For example, given the stack effect \fB( a b c -- )\fP we would say that \fBc\fP is the top of the stack, \fBb\fP is the second value (second from the top), and \fBa\fP is the third value (third from the top).

.SH REGULAR INSTRUCTIONS

.BR

.SS INC ( x -- x+1 )

Increment the top value of the stack by 1.

Overflow will be truncated, so \fB#ff INC\fP will evaluate to \fB0x00\fP.

.SS POP ( x -- )

Remove the top value of the stack.

\fBPOPk\fP is guaranteed to have no effect (it will not change the stack).

.SS NIP ( x y -- y )

Remove the second value of the stack.

\fBNIPk\fP is guaranteed to have no effect (it will not change the stack).

.SS SWP ( x y -- y x )

Swap the top two values of the stack.

.SS ROT ( x y z -- y z x )

Rotate the top three values of the stack. The lowest becomes the top and the others are each shifted down one place.

.SS DUP ( x -- x x )

Place a copy of the top value of the stack on top of the stack.

.SS OVR ( x y -- x y x )

Place a copy of the second value of the stack on top of the stack.

.SS EQU ( x y -- x==y^ )

Test whether the top two values of the stack are equal.

Result is guaranteed to be boolean (\fB0x00\fP or \fB0x01\fP).

.SS NEQ ( x y -- x!=y^ )

Test whether the top two values of the stack are not equal.

Result is guaranteed to be boolean (\fB0x00\fP or \fB0x01\fP).

.SS GTH ( x y -- x>y^ )

Test whether the second value of the stack is greater than the top.

Result is guaranteed to be boolean (\fB0x00\fP or \fB0x01\fP).

.SS LTH ( x y -- x<y^ )

Test whether the second value of the stack is less than the top.

Result is guaranteed to be boolean (\fB0x00\fP or \fB0x01\fP).

.SS JMP ( x -- ; pc <- x )

Jump to a location.

The program counter (\fIpc\fP) is unconditionally updated. When \fIx\fP is a byte, it is treated as relative (\fBpc += x\fP) and when \fIx\fP is a short it is treated as absolute (\fBpc = x\fP).

It is common to \fBJMP\fP with boolean bytes (0-1) to handle simple conditionals. For example:

    @max ( x^ y^ -- max^ ) GTHk JMP SWP POP JMP2r

.SS JCN ( bool^ x -- ; pc <- x if bool )

Jump to a location when a condition is true.

The program counter (\fIpc\fP) is updated when \fIbool\fP is non-zero. When \fIx\fP is a byte, it is treated as relative (\fBpc += x\fP) and when \fIx\fP is a short it is treated as absolute (\fBpc = x\fP).

.SS JSR ( x -- [pc+1*] )

Jump to a location, saving a reference to return to.

Stores the next address to execute before unconditionally updating the program counter (\fIpc\fP). This instruction is usually used to invoke subroutines, which use the \fBJMP2r\fP to return. When \fIx\fP is a byte, it is treated as relative (\fBpc += x\fP) and when \fIx\fP is a short it is treated as absolute (\fBpc = x\fP).

The saved address will always be a short regardless of \fIshort mode\fP.

.SS STH ( x -- [x] )

Move the top value of the stack to the return stack.

.SS LDZ ( zp^ -- x )

Load data from a zero-page address (\fB0x00 - 0xff\fP).

.SS STZ ( x zp^ -- )

Store data at a zero-page address (\fB0x00 - 0xff\fP).

.SS LDR ( rel^ -- x )

Load data from a relative address (\fBpc + x\fP).

Note that unlike \fBLDZk\fP and \fBLDAk\fP the \fBLDRk\fP instruction is not very useful, since a relative address is usually only meaningful when run from a particular address (i.e. for a particular \fIpc\fP value).

.SS STR ( x rel^ -- )

Store data at a relative address (\fBpc + x\fP).

Note that unlike \fBSTZk\fP and \fBSTAk\fP the \fBSTRk\fP instruction is not very useful, since a relative address is usually only meaningful when run from a particular address (i.e. for a particular \fIpc\fP value).

.SS LDA ( abs* -- x )

Load data from an absolute address (\fB0x0000 - 0xffff\fP).

.SS STA ( x abs* -- )

Store data at an absolute address (\fB0x0000 - 0xffff\fP).

.SS DEI ( dev^ -- x )

Read data from a device port (\fB0x00 - 0xff\fP).

Reading from some ports may have an effect on the underlying VM; in other cases it will simply read values from device memory. See Varvara device documentation for more details.

.SS DEO ( x dev^ -- )

Write data to a device port (\fB0x00 - 0xff\fP).

Writing to some ports may have an effect on the underlying VM; in other cases it will simply write values to device memory. See Varvara device documentation for more details.

.SS ADD ( x y -- x+y )

Add the top two values of the stack.

Overflow will be truncated, so \fB#ff #03 ADD\fP will evaluate to \fB0x02\fP.

.SS SUB ( x y -- x-y )

Subtract the top of the stack from the second value of the stack.

Underflow will be truncated, so \fB#01 #03 SUB\fP will evaluate to \fB0xfe\fP.

.SS MUL ( x y -- xy )

Multiply the top two values of the stack.

Overflow will be truncated, so \fB#11 #11 MUL\fP will evaluate to \fB0x21\fP.

.SS DIV ( x y -- x/y )

Divide the second value of the stack by the top of the stack.

\fBDIV\fP implements \fIEuclidean division\fP, which is also known as \fIinteger division\fP. It returns whole numbers, so \fB#08 #09 DIV\fP evaluates to \fB0x00\fP.

Division by zero will return zero (instead of signaling an error).

Unlike \fBADD\fP, \fBSUB\fP, and \fBMUL\fP, \fBDIV\fP does not behave correctly for numbers which should be treated as signed. For example, the signed byte representation of \fB-2\fP is \fB0xfe\fP, but \fB#06 #fe DIV\fP evaluates to \fB0x00\fP (\fB6 / 254 = 0\fP). For signed values the correct result should instead be \fB0xfd\fP (\fB6 / -2 = -3\fP).

There is no \fIremainder\fP instruction, but the phrase \fBDIVk MUL SUB\fP can be used to compute the remainder.

.SS AND ( x y -- x&y )

Compute the bitwise union of the top two values of the stack.

.SS ORA ( x y -- x|y )

Compute the bitwise intersection of the top two values of the stack.

.SS EOR ( x y -- x^y )

Compute the bitwise exclusive-or (\fIxor\fP) of the top two values of the stack.

.SS SFT ( x rl^ -- (x>>l)<<r )

Compute a bit shift of the second value of the stack; the directions and distances are determined by the top value of the stack.

Given a byte \fIrl\fP consisting of a low nibble (\fIl\fP) and a high nibble (\fIr\fP), this instruction shifts \fIx\fP left by \fIl\fP and then right by \fIr\fP.

Right shifts are unsigned (they introduce zero bits). There are no signed shifts.

For 16-bit (and 8-bit) values, one nibble (\fB0x0 - 0xf\fP) is sufficient to express all useful left or right shifts.

  Right: \fB#ff #03 SFT\fP evaluates to \fB0x1f\fP
  Left:  \fB#ff #20 SFT\fP evaluates to \fB0xfc\fP
  Both:  \fB#ff #23 SFT\fP evaluates to \fB0x7c\fP

.SH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions do not accept all mode flags (some do not accept any).

.SS BRK

The break instruction is used to end a vector call and return control to the virtual machine.

.SS JCI, JMI, and JSI

The "immediate jump" instructions are produced by the assembler. They interpret the next 2 bytes of the ROM as a relative address (\fIaddr\fP) and have the following effects:

 \fBJMI\fP ( -- )       jump to \fIaddr\fP unconditionally
 \fBJCI\fP ( bool^ -- ) jump to \fIaddr\fP if \fIbool\fP is non-zero
 \fBJSI\fP ( -- [pc*] ) jump to \fIaddr\fP saving the current address (\fIpc\fP) on \fIrst\fP

(The instruction pointer will be moved forward 2 bytes, past the relative address.)

These instructions are created by the assembler from special syntax:

    \fB!dest\fP produces \fBJMI wx yz\fP
    \fB?dest\fP produces \fBJCI wx yz\fP
    \fBdest\fP  produces \fBJSI wx yz\fP (assuming \fBdest\fP is not a macro or reserved)

.SS LIT, LIT2, LITr, and LIT2r

Push a literal value on the stack.

The "literal" instructions are used to push new data onto the stacks. They interpret the next 1-2 bytes of the ROM (\fIwx\fP, \fIwxyz\fP) as data and push it onto the corresponding stack:

    \fBLIT\fP   ( -- wx^ )     push literal byte \fIwx\fP onto the \fBwst\fP
    \fBLITr\fP  ( -- [wx^] )   push literal byte \fIwx\fP onto the \fBrst\fP
    \fBLIT2\fP  ( -- wxyz* )   push literal short \fIwxyz\fP (2 bytes) onto the \fBwst\fP
    \fBLIT2r\fP ( -- [wxyz*] ) push literal short \fIwxyz\fP (2 bytes) onto the \fBrst\fP

(The instruction pointer will be moved forward 1-2 bytes, past the literal data.)

Literal values can be updated dynamically using store instructions:

    #abcd ;x STA2
    ( later on... )
    LIT2 [ @x $2 ]
