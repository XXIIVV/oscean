<p>I am a citizen of the most beautiful nation on earth. A nation whose laws are
harsh yet simple, a nation that never cheats, which is immense and without
borders, where life is lived in the present. In this limitless nation, this
nation of wind, light, and peace, there is no other ruler besides the sea.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Deliberate practice</b>: Focused, consistent and goal-oriented training. It favours quality over quantity. It knows not all practice is created equal.</li>
	<li><b>Perfect Duty</b>: Perfect duties are duties that are blameworthy if not met, as they are a basic required duty for a human being.</li>
	<li><b>Maxim</b>: A concise expression of a fundamental moral rule or principle.</li>
	<li><b>Surrogate Activity</b>: An activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward.</li>
	<li><b>Wabisabi</b>: Acknowledgement that nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and that nothing is perfect.</li>
