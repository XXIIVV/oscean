It would have us believe that man is the centre of the universe, that all rights are his on the pretense that he invented the steam engine and lots of other machines, and that he will someday reach the stars if he just hurries a little before the next bomb.</p><h5>Bernard Moitessier, The Long Way</h5><q>They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven!
