In recent decades, by the process of looking(instead of merely assuming), ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the community as a whole.</p><p>This system of laws has been called, among other things, the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and <a href='vegan.html'>animal ethics</a>.</p><h3>altap links</h3><ul><li><a href='https://lowtechmagazine.com'>Low Tech</a></li><li><a href='http://criticalengineering.org'>CE Manifesto</a></li><li><a href='https://deepresource.wordpress.com'>Deep Resource</a></li><li><a href='http://www.designlife-cycle.com'>Design Lifecycle</a></li><li><a href='https://openstructures.net'>Open Structures</a></li><li><a href='http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange'>What Can A Technologist</a></li><li><a href='https://www.notechmagazine.com'>No Tech</a></li><li><a href='https://simplifier.neocities.org'>Simplifier</a></li><li><a href='https://wiki.opensourceecology.org'>Open Source Ecology</a></li></ul><h3>adaptation</h3><ul><li><b>Strong Longtermism</b>: The primary determinant of the value of our actions is the effects of those actions on the very long-run future.</li><li><b>The Hinge of History Hypothesis</b>: The hypothese that we are living at the most influential time ever.</li><li><b>Carbon Capture</b>: A technological negative emissions solution that aims to remove carbon from the air, storing it as inert material.
