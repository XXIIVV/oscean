<main><h2>Open computation that goes beyond open source, made from parts designed to
be recombined.</h2>

<p>Every layer of a malleable computing system is designed to support arbitrary
recombination, reused across environments and freely sharable with
others. Modifying such a system happens in the context of use, rather than
through some separate tool and skill set.</p>

<p>In constrast with monolithic applications, these amorphous computers are
finely tuned and thoughtfully crafted by their operator over the course of a
practice.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/super_chair.png'/>

<p>At its core, a malleable system is made of heterogeneous parts capable of
assemblage. Within the context of computation, it is an attribute shared by
different interoperable systems, not unlike programs that communicate via <a
href='unix.html#pipes'>unix pipes</a>, and some flow-based programming
environments.</p>

</center>

<p>A malleable part is a transformer in a chain of transformers, and is itself
also made of equally interconnected links, nodes or agents. The more malleable
a system, the blurrier the distinction in the granularity of these parts.</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><th colspan="4" style="text-align:center">Malleability</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:black;color:white">Silo</td>
		<td>A system in which nodes will forcefully captures the message is a <b>silo</b>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#a0ffa0;color:black">Shallow</td>
		<td>Messages can enter and leave a system that is not malleable itself,
this is malleability of a superficial kind.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#4fdd9a;color:black">Average</td>
		<td>Messages can flow freely between internal nodes of a malleable system, but
capabilties are restricted by domain, interface, or operator competency.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#47c199;color:black">Deep</td>
		<td>Messages can be passed seemlessly across every level of the system, the
division into <i>layers</i> has entirely vanished.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>A potential advantage to this granularity is the distribution of complexity so
that an operator can more gently transition toward a deeper understanding of
the finer parts that makes up the solution to a problem.</p>

<p><b>Design for reversibility</b>: For a system to be approachable from a wide
range of competency, it might be valuable to lower the cost of errors, and
limit the blame put upon its operator by favoring transformations that
can be undone.</p>

<p>Some automata conserve enough state through their transformation that
computation can happen backward, without cluttering large amount of memory with
<i>screenshots</i>.</p>

<center>
	<img src='../media/refs/pipe_both.png' style='width:75%'/>
</center>

<p>Familiar examples of reversible computation are the multiplication of a number
by a <a href='fractions.html'>fraction</a> and using the reciprocal to recover
that number, or the stack machine operation <i>rot</i>. The bitwise operator
<i>not</i> or the stack machine <i>swap</i> are <a
href='reversible_computing.html'>self-reversible examples</a>, which means that
same operator can applied once again to recover the earlier state.</p>

<p><b>Design for concatenation</b>: A point-free message passing paradigm that
does not identify the arguments on which it operates might prove valuable in a
<i>Deeply Malleable</i> system would it value both inspectability down to its
the mechanical transformation, and reasonable evaluation performance.</p>

<pre>
: SQUARED ( n -- n^2 ) DUP * ;
: CUBED ( n -- n^3 ) DUP SQUARED * ;
</pre>

<p>In such a system, nodes merely compose other nodes, among which are
combinators that manipulate the arguments, <i>regarless of context</i>. This is
a fancy way of saying that a concatenative subexpression can be replaced with a
<b>name</b> that represents that same subexpression.</p>

<pre>
: POPCNT ( n -- bits ) 0 swap
BEGIN dup WHILE tuck 1 AND + swap 1 rshift REPEAT
DROP ;
</pre>

<p>A maximally accessible system such that the finer details in movement of bits
are observable but that does not run on generic hardware would be paradoxal by
virtue of its inaccessibility. For that reason, depending on the host computer,
a function definition like the one above(which might exist as a single opcode),
should probably still be part of the observable system definitions even if it
is not evaluated.</p>

<p><b>Design for diversity</b>: For the technical infrastructures of malleable
software to support networks of people collaborating together, across many
levels of competancy, to make software work for themselves and their
communities. Such a system will surely be connecting wildly different
interfaces and notations.</p>

<p>The rewriting language <a
href='https://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/maude1/manual/maude-manual-html/maude-manual_31.html'
target='_blank'>Maude</a>, uses a <i>mixfix notation</i> making the system
neither prefix, infix, or postfix, but adaptable to the user's needs and
background. To demonstrate something akin to the mixfix notation and give a
taste of rewriting, consider a system made of rules where a given <i>left-hand
side</i> is replaced by its corresponding <i>right-hand side</i>, and where
<code>?words</code> will match anything.</p>

<pre>
(add ?x ?y) -> (?x + ?y)
(?x ?y add) -> (?x + ?y)

((?a) + ?b) -> (?a + (?b))
(0 + ?b) -> (sum ?b)
</pre>
<pre style='margin-top:-29px'>
(add 1 2)
</pre>

<p>The first two rules of program above both enable the translation between
prefix & postfix, to the infix notation, as well as translating a symbol that
might otherwise be localized.</p>

<table border='1' style='float:right; margin-left:30px'>
	<tr><th colspan='2'>Even Check</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Message</th><th>Bit</th></tr>
	<tr style='font-family:mono'><td>1101 001</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Design for decay</b>: A message, as far as computers are concerned, is an
anonymous stream of bits in transit. Error correction is done by transmitting
additional information to catch information loss or tampering. For example, by
adding a <i>parity bit</i> that corresponds to the odd or even number of active
bits in a specific length of data.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/arecibo.png' style='width:400px'/>

<p>The Arecibo Message is an interstellar radio message for which reciever's
capabilities are unknown, the length of the message was chosen to be a
semiprime so its dimension(73 rows by 23 columns) could be infered from an
otherwise totally headerless message.</p>

<article>
	<p>A <i>decay hardened quine</i> refers to a programming concept where a quine
program, a program that prints its own source code, is designed to be robust
against character corruption or "decay."</p>
