<h2>Notes on home and travel.</h2>

<p>My first encounter with a nomad was during my stay in <a
href='czech.html'>Prague</a>. Already, <i>Home</i> was becoming an increasingly
vague concept at that moment in my life, but meeting someone who's home was
everywhere and nowhere had a profound effect on my young self.</p>

<p>The monthly rent of our beach-side appartment in Tokyo was of about 1.75K$,
and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing.
The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be
paid at the rate of 600$ per month. Or that by halving the costs of our current
living situation, we could become both "homeowners" while keeping our traveling
options open.</p>

<p>To think that, at the time, the harder things to let go of were instruments,
old consoles, books and some camera equipment. When the truly hard things to
let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet
connection. </p>

<p>Surely, I would not do all this for the sake of travel alone, I must have had
passions, habits and goals before I left everything to live on a sailboat. I
appears from that moment that everything that used to define me was beginning
to feel increasingly like distractions, <a
href='simulacra.html'>simulations</a> to protect me from truly experiencing
anything. I had never let myself feel cold, I had never felt hunger.</p>

<p>The wind rocks the ship sideways, keeping me up at night, but all I can feel
is that humbling sense of being present and part of that moment. I have long
forgotten about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, I
began to wonder why people even feel the need to take showers every day, and
time away from social networks really does make me feel better. I traded the
things I thought I cared about, for things I didn't know existed.</p>

<p>Eventually, I got back to building things, I learned how to fix sails, repair
a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine â€” Even to live
without power.</p>

<p>We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with
dolphins, we have climbed mountains on deserted islands, and we have met the
most amazing people. When it is our time to go, we will have no regrets, for we
were fortunate to have seen more than we could ever hope for.</p>
