<main><h2>A place that no mortal can ever reach.</h2>

<p>Every day shift is followed by a night shift, and every night shift by a day
shift, so neither will ever get the final word. The real course of immutable
history which we all share, then, must be the limit of an infinite number of
changes. The history that we all share is the final word once all the work has
been done.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/24juin.png' width='350'/>

<p>Since there will always have been a finite number of human generations
following the construction of the first time machine, and since the men of each
generation will only work a finite number of shifts during their lives, humans
will never be able to write the last of an infinite number of changes. If the
last word cannot be had by any mortal, then it must be had by some supernatural
entity. It is the thesis of the present interpretation that the final course of
history is determined by the will of God. <a

<img src='../media/refs/jeremy.png'/><h2>Arvelie is an alphabetic date format.</h2>

<p>The <b>Arvelie calendar</b> has <b>26 months</b> of <b>14 days</b> each.</p>

<p>Each month has <b>2 weeks</b> of <b>7 days</b>, and each month's name is one of the 26 letters of this alphabet. The 365th day of the year is the <i>Year Day</i>(+00), preceded by the <i>Leap Day</i>(+01) on leap years. The year zero defines when the journaling begins. For example, this <a href='oscean.html'>wiki</a> was initiated in 2006, which is its year 0. The arvelie date 13A05, is equivalent to January 6th of the 14th year.</p>
<p>The date format is principaly used as part of the daily logs recorded through the <a href='oscean.html'>Oscean</a> systems, but it was also adopted by others and can be found <a href='https://esoteric.codes' target='_blank'>in the wild</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>01D06</b> 2007-02-18</li>
	<li><b>02A00</b> 2008-01-01</li>
	<li><b>03F10</b> 2009-03-22</li>
	<li><b>14+01</b> 2020-12-31</li>
</ul>

<p>To calculate the <i>day of the year</i>, convert the month's letter to a value, starting with 0 for A, multiply by 14 and add the day of the month. For example, J05 is equal to <code>(+ 5 (* 9 14))</code>, or 131. Arvelie dates are often accompanied with <a href='neralie.html'>Neralie</a> time.</p>

<p>Arvelie time can be implemented in a few lines of <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> like:</p>

<h2>Neralie is a decimal time format.</h2>

<p>The <b>Neralie clock</b> has two groups of 3 digits, called the <i>beat</i> & the <i>pulse</i>. A beat contains 1000 pulses, and equivalent to <b>86.4 seconds</b>. A day is 1000 beats, or a million pulses. A pomodoro of 20 beats, is equivalent to 28 minutes 48 seconds.</p>
<ul><li><b>6:00</b> 250:000</li><li><b>12:00</b> 500:000</li><li><b>18:00</b> 750:000</li></ul>
<p>Neralie time is similar to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time' target='_blank'>Swatch Internet Time</a> decimal clock, but uses 6 decimal points and a rectangular watchface. You can find a <a href='pascal.html'>pascal</a> implementation for <a href='macintosh.html'>macintosh</a>, in the <a href='https://github.com/XXIIVV/Clock/tree/master/pascal' target='_blank'>clock repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Andrey Semyonovich went over to the table and took a drink from the cup of blackened water.</h2>

<p>The <a href='https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction/' target='_blank'>80'000h model</a> says that "You'll spend about 80,000 hours working in your career: <b>40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, for 40 years</b>".</p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.johnmaxwell.com/blog/dont-lose-your-marbles' target='_blank'>Jars of Marbles model</a> says that "The average person lives <b>about 75 years, of 52 weeks each, totaling 3,900 Saturdays</b> which the average person has in their lifetime."</p>

<p>To compare different chronic risks to one another, researchers came up with the concept of a <i>microlife</i>, defined as 30 minutes of life expectancy. Someone in their twenties may have about 57 years left of life on average, <b>about 20,000 days, a half-million hours, or one million microlives</b>.</p>

<p>Exercising for twenty minutes may add an two microlives to your life. So, for everyone who says they don’t have time to work out, exercising potentially gives a three-to-one return on investment. Give twenty minutes of your life to theoretically get sixty minutes of life. Beyond that, there’s a bit of diminishing returns, but exercise an hour a day and you still may get back more time than you put in.</p>

<q>When you tire of living, change itself seems evil, does it not? for then any
change at all disturbs the deathlike peace of the life-weary.</q>

<h3>What would a good death look like?</h3>

<p>It looks like retaining control, dignity,
and privacy. Choosing where and how you spend your last days. Being able to say
goodbye, and being able to leave when it is time to go and not have life
prolonged pointlessly. Having pain relief, emotional support, and respect for
your wishes.</p>

<p>What is it like to die from voluntarily stopping to eat and drink? There are a
lot of anecdotes floating around describing death from VSED as peaceful,
painless, and dignified. The average time of death after stopping eating and
drinking is about seven days, though 8 percent lived for more than two weeks.
The last days of life were rated as peaceful, with low levels of pain and
suffering, even more so than a physician-assisted death. Most hospice workers
said they would consider VSED themselves should they become terminally ill.</p>

<p>The state of terminal dehydration may even have some analgesic (painkilling)
effect, presumed to be due to the release of endorphins, which act as
natural pain blockers. So, concluded a systematic review published in a
palliative care journal, VSED may reflect all twelve principles of a <i>good
death</i>, with an emphasis on retaining dignity and control.</p>

<p>There are other side benefits to the dehydration process. There is less worry
about incontinence, catheters, or bedpans, and less nausea and vomiting as our
digestive secretions dwindle. Fewer respiratory secretions mean less coughing
and choking and fewer drowning sensations.</p>

<q>Cette absence sociale de la mort est identique à l'absence sociale de vie.</q>
<cite>Guy Debord, La Societe Du Spectacle</cite>

<!--

<p>Eating at least five daily servings of fruits and veggies may add an average of four years onto your lifespan. Smoking two cigarettes or drinking two pints of beer, on average, would cost a thirty-year-old man one microlife. </p>
