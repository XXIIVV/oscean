<main><h2>A virtual machine</h2>

<p>Emulation is the reproduction of the behavior of a computer's physical
circuitry with software. Given that an emulator can translate the actions of
one computer onto an other, the same program could be used on both.
<br/>This is called <b>emulation</b>.</p>

<p>Someone could devise the actions of a fictional computer that is not
necessarily based on existing hardware, write software for this fantastical
computer, implement an emulator for it, and use the same program on
supported systems.
<br/>This is called a <b>virtual machine</b>.</p>

<p>Over the years, I wrote software over various frameworks for a multitude of
peripherals. The vast majority is now defunct after <a
href='obsolescence.html'>vanishing with the platform</a> they were targetting
or by falling behind on the requirements of their ever-changing toolchains. <a
href='stack.html'>Bitrot</a> is the inability to access digital data because
hardware and software no longer exist to read its format. Perhaps it's just a
matter of time until people build emulators to make these projects usable
again, otherwise these projects were never truly mine, and my learning of these
languages <i>only ever belonged to the platforms</i>.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not <b>assembly</b>? While some of our computers share an architecture, cross-platform audio and graphical development is unlikely to work between them.</p>
</article>

<h3>I. An Adequate Number Of Bits</h3>

<p>During my research into portability, I kept thinking about how frictionless
it is to play <a href='famicom.html'>classic console games</a> today.
Pulling on that thread led me to projects designed explicitly for virtual
machines, such as <a href='https://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons/'
target='_blank'>Another World</a> which is equally easy to play today due to
its targeting of a portable virtual machine, instead of any ever-changing
physical hardware.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/mos6502.jpg' width="100" style='float:right'/>

<p>For a time, I thought I ought to be building software for the NES to ensure
their survival over the inflow of disposable <a
href='http://collapseos.org/why.html' target='_blank'>modern platforms</a>
&mdash; So, <a href='assembly.html'>I did</a>. Unfortunately, most of the
software that I care to write and use require slightly more than an 8-button
controller.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not the <b>Commodore 64</b>? Having implemented a NES emulator I found that, in comparison, implementing a c64 emulator is a monumental project.</p>
</article>

<h3>II. Tarpits & Houses Of Cards</h3>

<p>If the focus of this experiment is to ensure the support of a piece of
code by writing emulation software for each new platform, the specifications
should be painless to implement. Let's use the time one would need to write a
passable emulator as a limit in complexity for this system. Could a computer
science student implement an emulation of the 6502 instructions in an
afternoon? Could that design be simplified, changed in some way to make it more
approachable for would-be implementers?</p>

<img src='../media/refs/bthennota.png' width='100'/>

<ul>
	<li><a href='subleq.html'>Subleq</a> is a <i>One-Instruction</i> architecture
which takes at most 15 minutes to implement. But what it does away in emulation
complexity, it offloads onto the toolchain needed to make intelligible
programs.</li>
	<li><a href='smalltalk.html'>Smalltalk</a> is a complete computing environment and
virtual machine, that was said to take about a year for one person to
implement.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let us also set a limit to the complexity of the toolchain, since it would
be an equally Herculean task to build an <i>emulator and assembler</i> for a
machine with thousands of instructions; or a single instruction machine
building abstract logic from thousands of primitive parts.</p>

<p>The complexity of our virtual machine runtime and toolchain implementation
cannot exceed that which can be done within a weekend.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not the <b>Chifir</b>? Because of its very incomplete specification, unspecified behaviors, and lack of testing software, it is doubtful that general purpose computing is possible on such a system.</p>
</article>

<h3>III. Things Betwixt</h3>

<p>In 1964, a computer scientist proposed an abstract machine with <a
href='secd.html'>10 instructions</a> and 4 stacks. The superficially documented
implementation specifies a list processing system capable or hosting functional
languages. The system was later expanded with arithmetic and IO operations, but
rests on an intricate and inefficient garbage collected system.</p>

<p>In 1977, a programmer wrote a small virtual machine with <a
href='chip8.html'>36 instructions</a>, 16 registers and 4096 bytes of memory.
It had no mouse device, its controller is 16 keys organized in a square, the
screen is barely capable of displaying readable text, but I was able to write
an emulator and an assembler for it, in an weekend.</p>

<img src="../media/refs/computers.png" width="300">

<p>In the early 1980s , when computer access was still not yet widespread, a <a
href='paper_computer.html'>paper computer</a> was designed, consisting of a
piece of paper with 21 lines of <i>code</i> and eight registers. The
instruction set of five commands(inc, dec, jmp, isz, stp) is small but <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness' target='_blank'>Turing
complete</a>, meaning that it can approximately simulate the computational
aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer, and is therefore
enough to represent all mathematical functions.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not <b>Pico-8</b>? The Pico-8 comparison comes from people
conflating Uxn with <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>. A better comparison
would be Uxn and the Lua VM, that Pico-8 runs on, which isn't intended to be
targeted directly and its opcodes are an internal implementation detail that
regularly breaks between versions. On the other hand, Uxn is a VM focused on
long term stability, reimplantation, and portability.</p>

<p>Somewhere along this voyage into finding a suitable host for my programs, I
began thinking about <a href='collapse.html'>electronic waste</a>, and I
couldn't justify surrounding myself with <a href='salvage_computing.html'>yet
more electronics</a>. This dream platform would therefore be designed to be
emulated, its complexity would be designed around the complexity of software
and not that of hardware.</p>

<h3>IV. Back & Forth</h3>

<p>The balancing act of virtual machine instructions, assembler, emulator and the
resulting capabilities of its language eventually brought me back to stack machines.</p>

<img src="../media/refs/swap.png" alt="Swap operation by Leo Brodie">

<p><a href='concatenative.html'>Concatenative languages</a> consist of breaking a
program into a list of words, and to interpret each word, words are often
combinations of other words, combined to create more complex words. Brackets
and parentheses are unnecessary: the program merely performs calculations in
the order that is required, letting the automatic stack store intermediate
results on the fly for later use. Likewise, there is no requirement for
precedence rules.</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><td><i>operation</i></td><th>3</th><th>10</th><th>5</th><th>+</th><th>*</th></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="3"><i>stack</i></td><td rowspan="3">3</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td rowspan="3">45</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="2">3</td><td>10</td><td rowspan="2">3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In <a href='forth.html'>Forth</a>, memory is made of blocks of cells, which
are typically <a href='binary.html'>16-bits in length</a>, meaning that each
piece of data is a number from 0 to 65535. For this specific imaginary system,
I wanted the memory to consist of cells of 8-bit, or numbers from 0 to 255. For
example, the <code>12 / (34 - 12)</code> sequence is equivalent to the 6
bytes:</p>

<pre>
uxntal |  #  12  34 OVR SUB DIV
binary | a0  12  34  07  19  1b
</pre>

<p>Using stack-machine operations as primitives, along with enough arithmetic and
bitwise functions as to not require to abstract computation to a higher level
language, in order words to keep the assembly programming pleasant, we find the
resulting <a href='uxn.html'>virtual machine</a> and <a
href='uxntal_reference.html'>32 opcodes</a>. The result is an expressive and
extendable virtual machine that can be implemented in a weekend exposing a
user programmable assembly running at a reasonable speed. </p>

</pre>

<p>An implementation of the runtime, capable of running the self-hosted assembler
is about <a href="../etc/uxnmin.c.txt" target="_blank">150 lines of C</a>. Uxn
cannot error and has no <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-utils/tree/main/item/cli/opctest/opctest.tal'
target='_blank'>unspecified behaviors</a>. Its documentation encourages
re-implementation instead of adoption of a specific implementation. It operates
on bytes as to remain portable on small systems, abstracting I/O entirely to
the host system via dedicated opcodes. </p>
