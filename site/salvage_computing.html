<main><h2>Figuring out how to make the best possible use out of the millions of
devices which already exist.</h2>

<p>Salvage computing believes that the end of a computer product's lifecycle
should be seen as a moment of celebration, a moment when its socioeconomic
context can finally be reclaimed. Scavenge-friendly electronics are parts that
are no longer manufactured, but that are available by the billions in
landfills. Those who can manage to create new designs from scavenged parts with
low-tech tools will be able to preserve electronics.</p>

<p>It does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating for a
dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenuity to
turn problems into solutions, competition into co-operation and <a
href='solarpunk.html'>waste into resources</a>.</p>

<p id="encapsulation"><b>Design for Encapsulation</b>: In order to ensure that,
for example, a README file will be readable by any user, distribution disks
include a simple text-editing program that can display the README file. Though
most users already have one on their systems, software vendors should not to
assume that this will be the case.</p>

<p>When a file is compressed using PKZIP, a decompression program, such as
PKUNZIP, is required to expand the file. However, an option in PKZIP allows a
simple version of an unzip program to be bundled with each compressed file.
Choosing this option creates an executable file which, when run, expands
automatically to the original file, avoiding the issue of whether the recipient
of a compressed file will have the appropriate decompression software on
hand.</p>

<q>Any sufficiently organized Piracy is indistinguishable from Preservation.</q>

<p><b>Emulation</b> is a way of preserving the functionality and access to
digital information which might otherwise be lost due to technological <a
href='obsolescence.html'>obsolescence</a>. One of the benefits of the emulation
strategy compared with migration is that the original data need not be altered
in any way. It is the emulation of the computer environment that will change
with time. </p>

<p>A <b>universal virtual computer</b> needs to be well documented, contain a
bare minimum of functionality, be easily testable for compliance, and have
very, very few special cases in the specification, since special cases are
opportunities for incompatibility; but despite that, it needs to be a
reasonable target to write a compiler for. Finally, I argue that a UVC ought to
have predictable performance.</p>

<p>Software is <b>bootstrappable</b> when it does not depend on a binary seed that
cannot be built from source. Software that is not bootstrappable, even if it
is free software, is a serious security risk. The goal is to start from a
minimal, easily inspectable binary which should be readable as
source and bootstrap into a practical user interface.</p>

	<p>Creating may be something we are only able to do, not something we can
describe or understand. For this reason, technology must always play a
secondary role to the creation we wish to embody in our preserved records and
our preserved documents. It would be better to lose everything we have
recorded, and all of our technology, than to suffer even the slightest
diminution in our ability to create. </p>

<q>Wait. What nostalgia? This is not about reliving fond memories or fetishize
about an <a href='pastoral.html'>imaginary past</a>, it's about being tactical
in our choice of medium, so as to propagate a political perspective
efficiently.<a href="https://iodinedynamics.com/whatkind.html"
