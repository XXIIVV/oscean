The main advantage of this technique is that it makes use of only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by two. The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number. For the decomposition, they proceeded methodically; they would initially find the largest power of two less than or equal to the number in question, subtract it out and repeat until nothing remained.</p>

<p>Example of the decomposition of the number 25, the largest power of two less than or equal to 25 is 16, then 9 and lastly 1. 25 is thus the sum of: 16, 8 and 1. </p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><th>25 − 16</th><td>9</td></tr>
	<tr><th>9 − 8</th><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><th>1 − 1</th><td>0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>After the decomposition of the first multiplicand, it is necessary to construct a table of powers of two times the second multiplicand (generally the smaller) from one up to the largest power of two found during the decomposition. In the table, a line is obtained by multiplying the preceding line by two.</p>

<p>For example, if the largest power of two found during the decomposition is 16 (as in the case of the decomposition of 25, and the second multiplicand is 7, the table is created as follows:</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>14</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>28</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8</td><td>56</td></tr>
	<tr><td>16</td><td>112</td></tr> 
</table>

<p>The result is obtained by adding the numbers from the second column for which the corresponding power of two makes up part of the decomposition of the first multiplicand. In the example above, as 25 = 16 + 8 + 1, add the corresponding multiples of 7 to get 25⋅7 = 112 + 56 + 7 = 175.</p>

<h3>Addition of 5</h3>
<p>When adding 5 to a digit greater than 5, it is easier to first subtract 5 and then add 10.</p>
<pre>
7 + 5 = 12.
Also 7 - 5 = 2; 2 + 10 = 12.
</pre>

<h3>Subtraction of 5</h3>
<p>When subtracting 5 from a number ending with a a digit smaller than 5, it is easier to first add 5 and then subtract 10.<p>
<pre>
23 - 5 = 18.
Also 23 + 5 = 28; 28 - 10 = 18.
</pre>

<h3>Division by 5</h3>
<p>Similarly, it's often more convenient instead to multiply first by 2 and then divide by 10.</p>
<pre>1375/5 = 2750/10 = 275.</pre>

<h3>Multiplication by 5</h3>
<p>It's often more convenient instead of multiplying by 5 to multiply first by 10 and then divide by 2.</p>
<pre>137×5 = 1370/2 = 685.</pre>

<h3>Division/multiplication by 4</h3>
<p>Replace either with a repeated operation by 2.</p>
<pre>

<!--
Any Square.
Assume you want to find 87². Find a simple number nearby - a number whose square could be found relatively easy. In the case of 87 we take 90. To obtain 90, we need to add 3 to 87; so now let's subtract 3 from 87. We are getting 84. Finally,

87² = 90×84 + 3² = 7200 + 360 + 9 = 7569.

More examples and explanation
Squares Can Be Computed Squentially
In case A is a successor of a number with a known square, you find A⊃ by adding to the latter itself and then A. For example, A = 111 is a successor of a = 110 whose square is 12100. Added to this 110 and then 111 to get A²:

111²	= 110² + 110 + 111
 	= 12100 + 221
 	= 12321.

More examples and explanation
Squares of numbers that end with 5.
A number that ends in 5 has the form A = 10a + 5, where a has one digit less than A. To find the square A² of A, append 25 to the product a×(a + 1) of a with its successor. For example, compute 115². 115 = 11×10 + 5, so that a = 11. First compute 11×(11 + 1) = 11×12 = 132 (since 3 = 1 + 2). Next, append 25 to the right of 132 to get 13225!

More examples and explanation
Product of 10a + b and 10a + c where b + c = 10.
Similar to the squaring of numbers that end with 5:

For example, compute 113×117, where a = 11, b = 3, and c = 7. First compute 11×(11 + 1) = 11×12 = 132 (since 3 = 1 + 2). Next, append 21 (= 3×7) to the right of 132 to get 13221!

More examples and explanation
Product of two one-digit numbers greater than 5.
This is a rule that helps remember a big part of the multiplication table. Assume you forgot the product 7×9. Do this. First find the excess of each of the multiples over 5: it's 2 for 7 (7 - 5 = 2) and 4 for 9 (9 - 5 = 4). Add them up to get 6 = 2 + 4. Now find the complements of these two numbers to 5: it's 3 for 2 (5 - 2 = 3) and 1 for 4 (5 - 4 = 1). Remember their product 3 = 3×1. Lastly, combine thus obtained two numbers (6 and 3) as 63 = 6×10 + 3.

More examples and explanation
Product of two 2-digit numbers.

The simplest case is when two numbers are not too far apart and their difference is even, for example, let one be 24 and the other 28. Find their average: (24 + 28)/2 = 26 and half the difference (28 - 24)/2 = 2. Subtract the squares:

28×24 = 26² - 2² = 676 - 4 = 672.

The ancient Babylonian used a similar approach. They calculated the sum and the difference of the two numbers, subtracted their squares and divided the result by four. For example,
 	33×32	= (65² - 1²)/4
 	 	= (4225 - 1)/4
 	 	= 4224/4
 	 	= 1056.

More examples and explanation
Product of numbers close to 100.
Say, you have to multiply 94 and 98. Take their differences to 100: 100 - 94 = 6 and 100 - 98 = 2. Note that 94 - 2 = 98 - 6 so that for the next step it is not important which one you use, but you'll need the result: 92. These will be the first two digits of the product. The last two are just 2×6 = 12. Therefore, 94×98 = 9212.

More examples and explanation
Multiplying by 11.
To multiply a 2-digit number by 11, take the sum of its digits. If it's a single digit number, just write it between the two digits. If the sum is 10 or more, do not forget to carry 1 over.

For example, 34×11 = 374 since 3 + 4 = 7. 47×11 = 517 since 4 + 7 = 11.
Faster subtraction.
Subtraction is often faster in two steps instead of one.

For example,

427 - 38 = (427 - 27) - (38 - 27) = 400 - 11 = 389.

A generic advice might be given as "First remove what's easy, next whatever remains". Another example:

1049 - 187 = 1000 - (187 - 49) = 900 - 38 = 862.
Faster addition.
Addition is often faster in two steps instead of one.

For example,

487 + 38 = (487 + 13) + (38 - 13) = 500 + 25 = 525.

A generic advice might be given as "First add what's easy, next whatever remains". Another example:

1049 + 187 = 1100 + (187 - 51) = 1200 + 36 = 1236.
Faster addition, #2.
It's often faster to add a digit at a time starting with higher digits. For example,

583 + 645	= 583 + 600 + 40 + 5
 	= 1183 + 40 + 5
 	= 1223 + 5
 	= 1228.
Multipliply, then subtract.
When multiplying by 9, multiply by 10 instead, and then subtract the other number. For example,

23×9 = 230 - 23 = 207.

More examples and explanation

The same applies to other numbers near those for which multiplication is simplified:
 	23×51	= 23×50 + 23
		= 2300/2 + 23
		= 1150 + 23
		= 1173.
 	 	 
 	87×48	= 87×50 - 87×2
		= 8700/2 - 160 - 14
		= 4350 - 160 - 14
		= 4190 - 14
		= 4176.
