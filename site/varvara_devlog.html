<h2>A personal computer</h2>

<p>What are computers for, anyway?</p>

<p>I think of a computer as a lens through which I can observe and listen to the
natural world. Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of
mathematics is closer to discovery than invention. Mathematical beauty is the
aesthetic pleasure derived from the abstractness, or orderliness of
mathematics. Similarly to how one might enjoy spending time studying venation
patterns, we can imagine a device to explore procedural music and parametric
illustration.</p>

<p>A romantic vision of the <a href='anarchy.html'>luddite</a>, potentially
emancipating, power of computing was promptly smothered by military drones,
surveillance hardware and the advertisement machinery. Suffice to say, that
nowadays, to most of my friends, computing evokes either encroaching social
networks or the drudgery of data entry.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm making it more difficult than necessary by using the term
<i>personal computer</i>, and not finding a more apt word to describe what I
have in mind.</p>

<h3>I. Personal</h3>

<p>Let's consider the whole enterprise of designing and documenting this
fictional computer to be a sort of <i>model</i> that others could adapt to
their own <a href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>designs</a>, a call to encourage
individuals to conjure up <b>their own vision of a computing machine</b>,
tailored to suit their own needs; And Varvara, a demonstration of the potential of
personal computing systems, and not as a platform that should be adopted and
adapted to fit broader computing needs.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is not to gather would be users, but instead
review potential portable computing skills that are not platform-specific, and
to serve as a reminder that the key to permaculture's resilience is achieved
through a diversification of methods.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/house.png' width='400'/>

<p>I am certain that making something unique by way of customization is
necessary for care, <i>for when the unique breaks, </i><a
href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/that-which-is-unique-breaks'
target='_blank'>we might mend</a>. I often think back on how, in the movie
Hackers(1995), each character had their own laptop launch sequence reflecting
their aesthetics. &mdash; A far cry from today's <a
href='commodity.html'>disposable laptops</a>, each equally adorned of
<i>proprietary services</i> stickers.</p>

<p>For mending to even be envisaged, one must be able to generally understand
that which needs to be mended; a venture which, thanks to the ever
complexifying <a href='stack.html'>stack</a> upon which modern computing is
built, will have you promptly laughed out of the room. But just for the sake of
this article, the required understanding of a system shall end at its
bytecode bedrock.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/varvara.chill.png' width="200" />

<p>A side-effect of working from within unique computing environments is that
looking for generic solutions is often more impractical than solving the
problem head on. By that, I mean by that the solution needs to be adapted to
the specifics of the virtual system, and this in turn develops understanding
and care.</p>

<h3>II. Computer</h3>

<p>The computer in this case is the sum of potential I/O communications with
the underlying virtual machine. In this case, the VM can communicate with up to
16 devices at once, but has no knowledge of what a screen or a keyboard might
be, these devices are what make up the <i>computer</i>.</p>

<q>Uxn is to Varvara, what the 6502 is to the Classic Nintendo.</q>

<p>When it came time to find out how I might want to interact with this
computer, I started with a terminal, it seemed as good a place as any to start
off from, by terminal I mean a console to send and receive bytes of data. The
terminal communication allows me to leverage the power of the host OS to
further develop the system.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/uxn.devices.png' width='350'/>

<p>As the system begins to take shape, I consider that possibly someday I may
lose my sight, or the use of my hands, or I may become deaf. I wonder how I
might replace one device for another in the future, and how I might adapt each
device to my changing needs. I leave some blank spaces to be filled at a later
time, should I need them.</p>
