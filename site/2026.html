	<h2>2026-02-11 Ink & Switch Madrid</h2>
	<p>Rek and I have just returned from a delightful couple of days deep in the wintry <a href='spain.html'>Spanish countryside</a>, holed up in a labyrinthine medieval monastery with the <a href='https://www.inkandswitch.com/' target='_blank'>Ink & Switch</a> team.</p>
	<p>It does my mood something good to sit among peers who are singularly focused on researching how to make the craft of computing more approachable, robust and playful. The activity of hand-crafting software seems unfortunately a rather radical and rebellious practice right now. But a sort of push back, or at least, willingness to challenge the prevailing narrative recurred in nearly every session I attended, at times lasting late into the night.</p>
	<p>I especially enjoyed geeking out about <a href='smalltalk.html'>Smalltalk</a> & Self with Dan Ingalls, playtesting Lilith Duncan's game, reciting Ivan Reese's <a href='https://github.com/ivanreese/2222' target='_blank'>interminable list of four-letters words</a>, sharing a day with folks from <a href='merveilles.html'>Merveilles</a> whom I had been meaning to meet in person for the longest time, finding a zipline and calisthenics park among the olive trees and stuffing my face with bread.</p>
	<p>It wasn't all good news tho, I experienced <i>sopa de ajo blanco</i> for the first(and last) time, and even after days of learning to operate these European light switches where the button is pressed down to light things up, I only ever managed the rocker correctly half the time.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Redrew some of <a href='left.html'>Left</a>'s glyphs.</li>
		<li>Created <a href='uxntal_library.html'>libraries</a> for standard Uxntal routines.</li>
		<li>Improved <a href='cccc.html'>CCCC</a>'s modal buttons, added reduce fraction button.</li>
		<li>Implemented a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/subleq-forth' target='_blank'>SUBLEQ interpreter</a> capable of running Forth-83.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed wandering the cobblestone streets of Chinchón.</li>

	<h2>2026-01-26 Sewing Machine</h2>
	<p>Isn't just wonderful that clothes come with their sources? If you slice the different parts off with a seamripper, lay them all down, trace them on new fabric, cut them out, and stitch them back together, you can effectively clone and fork garments. I realize that this is probably real obvious to most people, but it only dawned on me recently.</p>

<p>So, that’s what I’ve been up to, most nights my laptop is stowed away to make room for the sewing machine on the nav table. It all began when the store that made the patrol cap that Rek and I wear stopped carrying it. The seams of the old worn-out cap were cut, new 14oz canvas was bought and the cap was cloned, <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/115890346154400025' target='_blank'>twice</a>! I enjoyed the process so much, I made a new <a href='commuter_backpack.html'>messenger backpack</a>, fixed ripped panels on my winter jacket, sown tartan wool <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/115962663618543180' target='_blank'>arm warmers</a> and some other things. At one point, I realized that I was wearing six items of clothing I had made or mended.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Created an <a href='https://subversive.pics' target='_blank'>Instagram account</a>.</li>
		<li>Drawn dailies during <a href='ghostly_chanting.html'>Goblin Week</a>.</li>
		<li>Implemented <a href='soundex.html'>Soundex</a>.</li>
		<li>Wrote a page for the <a href='commuter_backpack.html'>backpack</a>.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed playing squash on rainy days.</li>

	<h2>2026-01-06 New Logo</h2>
	<p>Back in 2006, when the <a href='identity.html'>XXIIVV logo</a> was created, web 2.0 aesthetics were in full swing, outer glows and shiny vertical gradients were everywhere. As a reaction to that trend, I tried to design it as stark as possible, without decoration and without texture. The goal was for it to be representable using only a handful of Bézier control points which aligned with my style at the time.</p>
	<p>In 2026, the era of gradients and extrusion blendings has long passed, minimalism reigns supreme, logos are reduced to simple black shapes with not a single line that couldn't be justified to a board-meeting. So, I felt the urge to move away from all that, and get something closer to the works I do today, and at the same time, find a way to express my love for cursive and analog practices.</p>
	<p>In other words, the change was to go from a logo that can be written in a single stroke by a computer, to one that can be written in a single stroke by a person.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Started a new version of <a href='donsol.html'>Donsol</a>.</li>
		<li>Created a live playground for <a href='neur.html'>Neur</a>.</li>
		<li>Added volume controls to <a href='m291.html'>m291</a>.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed Aer Vacuum's <a href='https://youtube.com/watch?v=xYS3tytVll8' target='_blank'>Snake In Orca</a>.</li>
