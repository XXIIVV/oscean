<h2>Notes on Routine and Habits.</h2>

<p>A <b>typical day</b> usually begins at around 6:00am. I rise and work-out with
a mix of weights and callisthenics for an hour on an empty stomach. I have
breakfast, a protein shake, 5g-10g creatine, and a coffee. I usually ever
<b>only drink one cup</b> per day.</p>

<p>I immediately set off to complete the tasks I have waiting in my <a
href='hpda.html'>notes</a>. I have about 3 hours of undisturbed flow before the
distraction surrounding lunch-time pulls me away from the work. My goal for
each day, is to complete at least <b>a single task</b> that should take about 3
hours to complete â€” Or between 4 to 5 pomodoros.</p>

<p>After the last pomodoro, I usually <b>cook for a half-hour</b>, and then
<b>eat for a half-hour</b>, and then <b>walk for an hour</b>, to fully leave
the haze of the <i>flowstate</i>. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance
aboard, superficial work and experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent
reading and learning. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake
up to the next day and to experiment with.</p>

<p>The superficial work that I do involves answering emails, replying to forums,
editing wikipedia entries, doing maintenance to various repositories, and so
on..</p>

<p>The day ends with <b>journaling for a half-hour</b> at which point I record
the tasks done, and the <a href='mirrors.html'>lessons learned</a>. Before
sleeping, I usually <b>read for a half-hour</b>, I go to bed with a <a
href='reading.html'>book</a>, and a highlighter pen. I overline the things I
want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.</p>

<p>I have kept journals recording the oscillation of <b>Efficiency</b> and
<b>Effectiveness</b>, and used this data to optimize and navigate my own
personal tempers. Based on previously recorded patterns, I assign to myself
each day a single task to complete. The task is chosen specifically to utilize
the optimal amount of available stamina.</p>

<p>When a workday ends before the daily tasks are completed, the day was a
planning failure; and the tasks are broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned
to one day. When a task is completed too early, the day is also a planning
failure.</p>

<p>I try to not go to sleep until I have recorded the events of day in some form,
and ideas for the next one. The ideas are selected in the following order: I
first address the problems that slow me down, the things I find lacking in my
life and the answers to questions that occupies my mind and keep me up at
night.</p>

<q>You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you
vote, but what you spend your time on.</q>
