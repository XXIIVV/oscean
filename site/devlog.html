<p>The realization of this project is largely due to the work of the community,
with special thanks to Andy Alderwick, Sigrid Solveig Haflínudóttir, Andrew
Richards, and everyone else who contributed ideas and shared their knowledge
with me, without which Uxn could not have become what it is now. Nearly a year
after its initial draft, <a
href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>a lot of
uxn code</a> has been written. In fact, this text has been written in <a
href='left.html'>Left</a>, a text-editor hosted on this strangely personal
computer, and this <a href='about.html'>wiki</a> was also generated by it.</p>
<h2>A virtual machine</h2>

<p>Emulation is the reproduction of the behavior of a computer's physical
circuitry with software. Given that an emulator can translate the actions of
one computer onto an other, the same program could be used on both.
<br/>This is called <b>emulation</b>.</p>

<p>Someone could devise the actions of a fictional computer that is not
necessarily based on existing hardware, write software for this fantastical
computer, implement an emulator for it, and use the same program on
supported systems.
<br/>This is called a <b>virtual machine</b>.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/magiciens.png' alt='Le Matin des magiciens, by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier. 1963' width='200'/>

<p>Over the years, I wrote software over various frameworks for a multitude of
peripherals. The vast majority is now defunct after <a
href='obsolescence.html'>vanishing with the platform</a> they were targetting
or by falling behind on the requirements of their ever-changing toolchains. <a
href='stack.html'>Bitrot</a> is the inability to access digital data because
hardware and software no longer exist to read its format. Perhaps it's just a
matter of time until people build emulators to make these projects usable
again, otherwise these projects were never truly mine, and my learning of these
languages <i>only ever belonged to the platforms</i>.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not <b>assembly</b>? While some of our computers share an architecture, cross-platform audio and graphical development is unlikely to work between them.</p>
</article>

<h3>I. An Adequate Number Of Bits</h3>

<p>During my research into portability, I kept thinking about how frictionless
it is to play <a href='famicom.html'>classic console games</a> today.
Pulling on that thread led me to projects designed explicitly for virtual
machines, such as <a href='https://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons/'
target='_blank'>Another World</a> which is equally easy to play today due to
its targeting of a portable virtual machine, instead of any ever-changing
physical hardware.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/mos6502.jpg' width="100" style='float:right'/>

<p>For a time, I thought I ought to be building software for the NES to ensure
their survival over the inflow of disposable <a
href='http://collapseos.org/why.html' target='_blank'>modern platforms</a>
&mdash; So, <a href='assembly.html'>I did</a>. Unfortunately, most of the
software that I care to write and use require slightly more than an 8-button
controller.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not the <b>Commodore 64</b>? Having implemented a NES emulator I found that, in comparison, implementing a c64 emulator is a monumental project.</p>
</article>

<h3>II. Tarpits & Houses Of Cards</h3>

<p>If the focus of this experiment is to ensure the support of a piece of
code by writing emulation software for each new platform, the specifications
should be painless to implement. Let's use the time one would need to write a
passable emulator as a limit in complexity for this system. Could a computer
science student implement an emulation of the 6502 instructions in an
afternoon? Could that design be simplified, changed in some way to make it more
approachable for would-be implementers?</p>

<img src='../media/refs/bthennota.png' width='100'/>

<ul>
	<li><a href='subleq.html'>Subleq</a> is a <i>One-Instruction</i> architecture
which takes at most 15 minutes to implement. But what it does away in emulation
complexity, it offloads onto the toolchain needed to make intelligible
programs.</li>
	<li><a href='smalltalk.html'>Smalltalk</a> is a complete computing environment and
virtual machine, that was said to take about a year for one person to
implement.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let us also set a limit to the complexity of the toolchain, since it would
be an equally Herculean task to build an <i>emulator and assembler</i> for a
machine with thousands of instructions; or a single instruction machine
building abstract logic from thousands of primitive parts.</p>

<p>The complexity of our virtual machine runtime and toolchain implementation
cannot exceed that which can be done within a weekend.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not the <b>Chifir</b>? Because of its very incomplete specification, unspecified behaviors, and lack of testing software, it is doubtful that general purpose computing is possible on such a system.</p>
</article>

<h3>III. Things Betwixt</h3>

<p>In 1964, a computer scientist proposed an abstract machine with <a
href='secd.html'>10 instructions</a> and 4 stacks. The superficially documented
implementation specifies a list processing system capable or hosting functional
languages. The system was later expanded with arithmetic and IO operations, but
rests on an intricate and inefficient garbage collected system.</p>

<p>In 1977, a programmer wrote a small virtual machine with <a
href='chip8.html'>36 instructions</a>, 16 registers and 4096 bytes of memory.
It had no mouse device, its controller is 16 keys organized in a square, the
screen is barely capable of displaying readable text, but I was able to write
an emulator and an assembler for it, in an weekend.</p>

<img src="../media/refs/computers.png" width="300">

<p>In the early 1980s , when computer access was still not yet widespread, a <a
href='paper_computer.html'>paper computer</a> was designed, consisting of a
piece of paper with 21 lines of <i>code</i> and eight registers. The
instruction set of five commands(inc, dec, jmp, isz, stp) is small but <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness' target='_blank'>Turing
complete</a>, meaning that it can approximately simulate the computational
aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer, and is therefore
enough to represent all mathematical functions.</p>

<article>
	<p>So, why not <b>Pico-8</b>? The Pico-8 comparison comes from people
conflating Uxn with <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>. A better comparison
would be Uxn and the Lua VM, that Pico-8 runs on, which isn't intended to be
targeted directly and its opcodes are an internal implementation detail that
regularly breaks between versions. On the other hand, Uxn is a VM focused on
long term stability, reimplantation, and portability.</p>
</article>

<img src='../media/refs/ma.png' style='float:right; margin-left:30px; width:100px'/>
<p>Somewhere along this voyage into finding a suitable host for my programs, I
began thinking about <a href='collapse.html'>electronic waste</a>, and I
couldn't justify surrounding myself with <a href='salvage_computing.html'>yet
more electronics</a>. This dream platform would therefore be designed to be
emulated, its complexity would be designed around the complexity of software
and not that of hardware.</p>

<h3>IV. Back & Forth</h3>

<p>The balancing act of virtual machine instructions, assembler, emulator and the
resulting capabilities of its language eventually brought me back to stack machines.</p>

<img src="../media/refs/swap.png" alt="Swap operation by Leo Brodie">

<p><a href='concatenative.html'>Concatenative languages</a> consist of breaking a
program into a list of words, and to interpret each word, words are often
combinations of other words, combined to create more complex words. Brackets
and parentheses are unnecessary: the program merely performs calculations in
the order that is required, letting the automatic stack store intermediate
results on the fly for later use. Likewise, there is no requirement for
precedence rules.</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><td><i>operation</i></td><th>3</th><th>10</th><th>5</th><th>+</th><th>*</th></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="3"><i>stack</i></td><td rowspan="3">3</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td rowspan="3">45</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="2">3</td><td>10</td><td rowspan="2">3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In <a href='forth.html'>Forth</a>, memory is made of blocks of cells, which
are typically <a href='binary.html'>16-bits in length</a>, meaning that each
piece of data is a number from 0 to 65535. For this specific imaginary system,
I wanted the memory to consist of cells of 8-bit, or numbers from 0 to 255. For
example, the <code>12 / (34 - 12)</code> sequence is equivalent to the 6
bytes:</p>

<pre>
uxntal |  #  12  34 OVR SUB DIV
binary | a0  12  34  07  19  1b
</pre>

<p>Using stack-machine operations as primitives, along with enough arithmetic and
bitwise functions as to not require to abstract computation to a higher level
language, in order words to keep the assembly programming pleasant, we find the
resulting <a href='uxn.html'>virtual machine</a> and <a
href='uxntal_reference.html'>32 opcodes</a>. The result is an expressive and
extendable virtual machine that can be implemented in a weekend exposing a
user programmable assembly running at a reasonable speed. </p>

<pre>
<b>LIT</b> a b c [P]
<b>JCI</b> a b c8?P+=[P]
<b>JMI</b> a b c P+=[P]
<b>JSI</b> a b c | P P+=[P]

<b>BRK</b> .        <b>EQU</b> a b==c        <b>LDZ</b> a b [c8]     <b>ADD</b> a b+c
<b>INC</b> a b c+1  <b>NEQ</b> a b!=c        <b>STZ</b> a [c8]=b     <b>SUB</b> a b-c
<b>POP</b> a b      <b>GTH</b> a b&gt;c         <b>LDR</b> a b [P+c8]   <b>MUL</b> a b*c
<b>NIP</b> a c      <b>LTH</b> a b&lt;c         <b>STR</b> a [P+c8]=b   <b>DIV</b> a b/c
<b>SWP</b> a c b    <b>JMP</b> a b P+=c      <b>LDA</b> a b [c16]    <b>AND</b> a b&c
<b>ROT</b> b c a    <b>JCN</b> a b8?P+=c     <b>STA</b> a [c16]=b    <b>ORA</b> a b|c
<b>DUP</b> a b c c  <b>JSR</b> a b | P P+=c  <b>DEI</b> a b &lt;c8&gt;     <b>EOR</b> a b^c
<b>OVR</b> a b c b  <b>STH</b> a b | c       <b>DEO</b> a &lt;c8&gt;=b     <b>SFT</b> a b&gt;&gt;c8l&lt;&lt;c8h
</pre>

<p>An implementation of the runtime, capable of running the self-hosted assembler
is about <a href="../etc/uxnmin.c.txt" target="_blank">150 lines of C</a>. Uxn
cannot error and has no <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-utils/tree/main/item/cli/opctest/opctest.tal'
target='_blank'>unspecified behaviors</a>. Its documentation encourages
re-implementation instead of adoption of a specific implementation. It operates
on bytes as to remain portable on small systems, abstracting I/O entirely to
the host system via dedicated opcodes. </p> 

<h2>A programming language</h2>

<p>It is fair to assume that programming with so few primitives, will make it
difficult for software tools, to infer meaning from a program's source files.
But we can still convey a lot of details about the intent of various data
structures by encoding information in the few tools at our disposal.</p>

<h3>I. Structural Editing</h3>

<p>Let's consider the following uxn program, and associated symbols file,
created with <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>:</p>

<pre>
<i>hello.rom</i>

a001 1560 0001 0040 0005 9480 1817 2194
20ff f722 6c48 656c 6c6f 2057 6f72 6c64
21

<i>hello.rom.sym</i>

0018 write           0100 ( -> )
0100 on-reset        0107 ( str* -: )
0107 &lt;print&gt;         010a ( -- )
010a &lt;print&gt;/while   010a ( send )
010f &lt;print&gt;/        010e ( loop )
0115 hello-txt
</pre>

<p>It is possible to <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnrea'
target='_blank'>recreate</a> a textual source file by walking through the
program data, drawing from the symbols file, as: first the labels, second the
sublabels, lastly the comments, and create the following valid program:</p>

<pre>
|0018 @write |0100 @on-reset ( -> ) ;hello-txt &lt;print&gt; BRK @&lt;print&gt; ( str* -: ) !& &while ( -- ) ( send ) LDAk .write DEO ( loop ) INC2 & LDAk ?&while POP2 JMP2r @hello-txt 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 
</pre>

<p>While this text stream can be reassembled into the program from which it
originates, it will first need to be <a
href='uxnfor.html'>reformatted</a> to be
readable as a programming artifact.</p>

<pre>
|0018 
@write 
|0100 
@on-reset ( -> )
	;hello-txt &lt;print&gt; BRK
@&lt;print&gt; ( str* -: )
	!& &while ( -- )
		( send ) LDAk .write DEO
		( loop ) INC2 & LDAk ?&while POP2 JMP2r
@hello-txt 
	48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64
</pre>

<p>By breaking on absolute padding, label tokens, non-defining comments, and
tabbing the content of sublabels, we can improve readability further and can
already return to something like what the original source file might have
looked like:</p>

<pre>
|0018 

@write

|0100 

@on-reset ( -> )
	;hello-txt &lt;print&gt;
	BRK

@&lt;print&gt; ( str* -: )
	!&
	&while ( -- )
		( send ) LDAk .write DEO
		( loop ) INC2 & LDAk ?&while
	POP2 JMP2r

@hello-txt
	"Hello 20 "World! 00
</pre>

<p>Finally, we can ensure that lines terminate on emiting
opcodes(STZ/STR/STA/DEO) and some immediate opcodes(JCI, JMI). To make explicit
that some routines are emiting, and therefore line-terminating, I chose to use
the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> format</code>.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/potato.png' width='100' style='float:right; margin-left: 30px'/>

<p>Labels marking the start of binary information use prefixes that communicate
to the reassembler, how to handle the content. For example, <i>txt</i> for
ascii characters, <i>icn</i> for 1-bit graphics and <i>chr</i> for 2-bit
graphics.</p>

<h3>II. Source Validation</h3>

<p>Lacking data types, there is not much to go on as far as static validation,
but there is still <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnrea'
target='_blank'>space</a> to explore here. Type inference in Uxntal is done by
checking the stack effect declarations of words, against the sum of stack
changes predicted to occur based on the arity of each token in their
bodies.</p>

<pre>
@add ( a* b* -: c* ) <i>Warning: Imbalance in @add of +2</i>
	DUP2 ADD2 <b>JMP2r</b>
</pre>

<p>Words that do not pass the stack-checker are generating a warning, and so
essentially this defines a very basic and permissive type system that
nevertheless catches some invalid programs and enables compiler optimizations.
</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b -: c ) <i>Warning: Imbalance in @routine of +1</i>
	EQUk <b>?&sub-routine</b>
	POP2 #0a JMP2r
	&sub-routine ( a b -: c*</b> )
		POP2 #000b JMP2r
</pre>

<h3>III. Peephole Optimization</h3>

<p>Routines are sequences of combinators that ingest values from the stacks,
some permutations of these combinators are obviously redundant and <a
href='uxnlin.html'>reducing</a> these
extraneous transformations can be done on source files, for example: </p>

<pre>
#12 #34 <b>SWP POP</b> -> NIP 
</pre>

<p>Tail-call optimization happen where jumps to subroutines are followed by
subroutine returns and can be replaced instead by a single jump. </p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b -: c )
	SWP ;function <b>JSR2 JMP2r</b> -> JMP2
</pre>

<p>Going one step further, routines that would otherwise terminate in a tail-call
optimization could even be relocated before their tail's location in memory and
do away with the ending jump altogether. Incidentally, we leave here a comment
marker to indicate to the stack-effect checker that the routine's tail will
fall-through.</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b -: c )
	SWP <b>;function JMP2</b> -> ( >> )

@function ( b a -: c )
	DIV JMP2r
</pre>

<p>These are just a handful of examples, <br />there is still many <a
href='uxntal_labyrinth.html'>more things to explore</a>.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/varvara.potato.png' width='200'/>

<p>The previous notes contain experiments done with <a
href='uxntal_software.html'>self-hosted tools</a>, from the assembly,
formatting, to the validation &mdash; each tool is written it the language that
it assembles, formats or validates. Each program follows the same pattern of
ingesting a file path, emitting errors and warnings through the Console/error
port, and emits the same file path through Console/write on success, making
them composable.</p>

<h2>A personal computer</h2>

<p>What are computers for, anyway?</p>

<p>I think of a computer as a lens through which I can observe and listen to the
natural world. Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of
mathematics is closer to discovery than invention. Mathematical beauty is the
aesthetic pleasure derived from the abstractness, or orderliness of
mathematics. Similarly to how one might enjoy spending time studying venation
patterns, we can imagine a device to explore procedural music and parametric
illustration.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/de_pictura.png' alt='De Pictura, Leon Battista Alberti. 1963' width='400'/>

<p>A romantic vision of the <a href='anarchy.html'>luddite</a>, potentially
emancipating, power of computing was promptly smothered by military drones,
surveillance hardware and the advertisement machinery. Suffice to say, that
nowadays, to most of my friends, computing evokes either encroaching social
networks or the drudgery of data entry.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm making it more difficult than necessary by using the term
<i>personal computer</i>, and not finding a more apt word to describe what I
have in mind.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/hello.png' alt='Hello, on Macintosh.' width='100'/>

<h3>I. Personal</h3>

<p>Let's consider the whole enterprise of designing and documenting this
fictional computer to be a sort of <i>model</i> that others could adapt to
their own <a href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>designs</a>, a call to encourage
individuals to conjure up <b>their own vision of a computing machine</b>,
tailored to suit their own needs; And Varvara, a demonstration of the potential of
personal computing systems, and not as a platform that should be adopted and
adapted to fit broader computing needs.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is not to gather would be users, but instead
review potential portable computing skills that are not platform-specific, and
to serve as a reminder that the key to permaculture's resilience is achieved
through a diversification of methods.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/house.png' width='400'/>

<p>I am certain that making something unique by way of customization is
necessary for care, <i>for when the unique breaks, </i><a
href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/that-which-is-unique-breaks'
target='_blank'>we might mend</a>. I often think back on how, in the movie
Hackers(1995), each character had their own laptop launch sequence reflecting
their aesthetics. &mdash; A far cry from today's <a
href='commodity.html'>disposable laptops</a>, each equally adorned of
<i>proprietary services</i> stickers.</p>

<p>For mending to even be envisaged, one must be able to generally understand
that which needs to be mended; a venture which, thanks to the ever
complexifying <a href='stack.html'>stack</a> upon which modern computing is
built, will have you promptly laughed out of the room. But just for the sake of
this article, the required understanding of a system shall end at its
bytecode bedrock.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/varvara.chill.png' width="200" />

<p>A side-effect of working from within unique computing environments is that
looking for generic solutions is often more impractical than solving the
problem head on. By that, I mean by that the solution needs to be adapted to
the specifics of the virtual system, and this in turn develops understanding
and care.</p>

<h3>II. Computer</h3>

<p>The computer in this case is the sum of potential I/O communications with
the underlying virtual machine. In this case, the VM can communicate with up to
16 devices at once, but has no knowledge of what a screen or a keyboard might
be, these devices are what make up the <i>computer</i>.</p>

<q>Uxn is to Varvara, what the 6502 is to the Classic Nintendo.</q>

<p>When it came time to find out how I might want to interact with this
computer, I started with a terminal, it seemed as good a place as any to start
off from, by terminal I mean a console to send and receive bytes of data. The
terminal communication allows me to leverage the power of the host OS to
further develop the system.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/uxn.devices.png' width='350'/>

<p>As the system begins to take shape, I consider that possibly someday I may
lose my sight, or the use of my hands, or I may become deaf. I wonder how I
might replace one device for another in the future, and how I might adapt each
device to my changing needs. I leave some blank spaces to be filled at a later
time, should I need them.</p>

<h2>Now lie in it.</h2>

<p>Autumn is just around the corner, and when the leaves begin to fall, it will
have been four years since the <a href='devlog.html'>early sketches</a> of a
personal computing system which became <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>. I thought it
would be interesting to look back and see what has happened since.</p>

<q>What problem was it supposed address?</q>

<p>Uxn was designed explicitly to be a minimal bytecode target capable of
preserving a handful of <a href='https://100r.co/site/oquonie'
target='_blank'>our projects</a>, and to be flexible enough to accommodate the
ones we had yet to make, in a way that would be portable and robust <a
href='https://100r.co/site/story.html' target='_blank'>against bitrot</a>.</p>

<p>In regard to preservation, time will tell if it was a success, but I can say
that it has taken 3 years for the <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>ISA</a> to be
frozen, and the tail end of that period only saw <a
href='https://lists.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn' target='_blank'>subtle</a> changes that
did not impact the projects made in the first two. The remaining work during
that time was primarily finding, documenting and testing against the remaining
undefined behaviors.</p>

<p>During these four years, I have seen countless developers <a
href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn'
target='_blank'>successfully implement</a> the <a
href='varvara.html'>runtime</a> from scratch without my help; this is giving me
hope that for as long as the documentation survives, developers can create new
emulators as the hardware platforms and operating systems continue to
evolve.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/varvara.uxn.png' style="width: 80%;margin: 0 auto 30px;display: block;"/>

<q>It is probably power hungry</q>

<p>Uxn, in part, was meant to help us reconcile the power-hungry tools we used
with the energy we could harvest from the solar generated aboard our <a
href='pino.html'>small boat</a>. It is commonly understood that virtual
machines are inefficient, I went ahead knowing that it might be self-defeating
to target a virtual machine in which transformations are so granular that it
would be hard for the host machine to optimize for.</p>

<p>In that way, Uxn is tolerably impractical, but it is also only one part of a
larger gesture towards reducing the strain on that resource, which requires
more than just putting a virtual machine at the center of it all; what was
possible to do on paper, outside the browser, or natively, was thereafter done
that way, but a few of our projects were still inextricably linked to portable
graphical applications.</p>

<p>Uxn might have helped a bit, but only so much; for instance, the <a
href='left.html'>text-editor</a> with which I am typing this article and use to
do near every <i>computery-thing</i>, uses dramatically <a
href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40805267' target='_blank'>less
energy than what I used previously</a>. But I wouldn't attribute any noticeable
power gain to the application running as a rom or natively. As a target, it shines
most brightly in helping me to reduce the cost of iterating during software
development itself, say we compare the minuscule drain of assembling a rom in
comparison to rebuilding a native graphical application or reloading a
webapp.</p>

<q>It doesn't solve a real problem</q>

<p>I am not convinced that computers solve any real problems either. Asking a
room full of software creators "<a
href='https://forum.merveilles.town/thread/35/what-are-computers-for%2c-anyway%3f-39/'
target='_blank'>what are computers for anyways?</a>" will get you little beyond
vague suggestions of bureaucratic utility, which leads me to question whether
bureaucracy is solving any real problems, and so on, <i>ad absurdum</i>.</p>

<p>But if we are to put any value in preserving digital art, music, video games
and other distractions from the very real problems that basic needs demand, it
might be worthwhile to address the problem head-on, and to encourage piracy at
a massive scale, by duplicating digital content locally, to give data a
chance to survive moving forward. Cloud platforms have all to win by making us
forget that we can utilize a specific length of bytes without their saying so,
and emulation is just <a href='permacomputing.html'>one of many ways</a> of
exploring this issue.</p>

<q>The problems it is trying to solve are self-inflicted</q>

<p>There is a <a href='https://www.gypsy-traveller.org/policy-publications/'
target='_blank'>time immemorial tradition</a> of discriminating against the
various flavors of nomadic vagabonds living in tents, cars, canal boats &mdash;
we are not exempt from that. On discussion forums, the economics of living on
the water without a permanent address seem to <a
href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41136598' target='_blank'>elude most
people</a>, leaving them to believe that this way of life is something only the
wealthy can do, that being in it is necessarily a deliberate choice untied from
economic realities and that we somehow reside outside the boundary of whom
deserve to be heard.</p>

<p>I don't think that our changing reality was what catalyzed my search for
alternatives, but it might have precipitated it. At that time, browsers hadn't
started force-feeding AI assistants, but it was already many years into Apple
devising new ways to sabotage the repair of devices; it was becoming obvious
that my choice to target the modern web browser for my little graphical toys
was a vote against decentralized general purpose computing, and one for its
homogenization by companies that were increasingly antagonistic to
our situation.</p>

<p>Four years ago, had our situation been different, I don't know that I would
have decided to stay with either iOS or web development. But even now, being
more familiar with the landscape, I am not sure that making use of pre-existing
systems would have been viable solutions for where we were trying to go.</p>

<q>It is too complicated, or not complicated enough</q>

<p>I noticed that Uxn attracts both esoteric and practical individuals. The
esoteric crowd looking at the Uxn specifications are rapid to point at <a
href='https://dercuano.github.io/notes/uvc-archiving.html'
target='_blank'>various alternatives</a> for which very little software exists,
and the practical ones, at the limitations and ways in which it is deficient,
"the memory is too small," "the opcodes too few," "stack machines are too
slow", and so on.</p>

</pre>

<p>Fortunately, I have seen people come around after looking back at the typical
projects that they enjoy doing, and how they can do them comfortably with less
means, but there is no denying that Uxn has a specific scope in mind which does
not accommodate all projects. That was never really its intended purpose, it
has many times over been successful in, not acquiring users, but getting
developers to explore their <a href='http://wastingmoves.com/laki.html'
target='_blank'>own visions</a> and finding joy there.</p>

<q>Was it all worth it?</q>

<p>Is it worth it to spend hundreds of hours to save what must amount to much,
<i>much</i>, less? It depends, if you think too much about where you're going,
you might lose respect for where you are. I have friends who were complaining
about a tool in 2020, they still are today; their throughput would not be much
improved had they spent a years detouring to rebuild a whole tech stack. For
others, who see their ideals and tools diverge, it might be encouraging to see
prior explorations in that space; to those, I can only say that it is very
unlikely that you will see building an environment that respects your values
and idiosyncrasies as a waste of time, it might even bring you closer to others
sharing in your struggles and who might become your friends.</p>

<p>Four years ago, I had doubts that it would work out, but time flies when
you're having fun!</p>
