<h2>From the Notebook.</h2>

<p>The <b>Notebook</b> is a collection of scribbles on various topics that have yet to find themselves permanently included in the <a href='oscean.html'>wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Are you looking for the <a href='sketchbook.html'>sketchbook</a>?</p>

<h3>spacetime</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Entropy</b>: Or Irreversibility, a lack of order or predictability, gradual decline into disorder.</li>
	<li><b>False Vacuum</b>: An hypothetical vacuum(space devoid of matter) that is not entirely stable. If a small region of the universe reached a more stable vacuum, this change would spread.</li>
	<li><b>Great Filter</b>: With no evidence of intelligent life other than ourselves, it appears that the process of starting with a star and ending with "advanced explosive lasting life" must be unlikely.</li>
	<li><b>Von Neumann probes</b>: Or Universal Assemblers, A spacecraft capable of replicating itself.</li>
	<li><b>Final anthropic principle</b>: Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, will never die out.</li>
	<li><b>Mathematical universe hypothesis</b>: Or Tegmark Universe, our external physical reality is a mathematical structure consisting of starting conditions with rules about how they are to evolve. Any universe that corresponds to a logically coherent mathematical object exists, but universes exist “more”(in some sense) in proportion to their underlying mathematical simplicity.</li>
	<li><b>Liminality</b>: The quality of ambiguity, or disorientation, that occurs during a middle stage, or a threshold. Liminal places can range from borders and frontiers to crossroads and airports, which people pass through but do not live in.</li>
	<li><b>Causality</b>: Relationship between a cause and an effect, where the effect is a direct consequence of the cause.</li>
	<li><b>Eternal Return</b>: A theory that the universe and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form an infinite number of times across infinite time or space.</li>
	<li><b>Super now</b>: A type of prediction taking things that are happening now and imagining that the future will be just like now, only “more extreme.”</li>
	<li><b>Teleology</b>: The study of things that happen for the sake of their future consequences. The fallacious meaning of it is that events are the result of future events.</li>
	<li><b>Prediction</b>: Statement or claim that a particular event will occur in the future in more certain terms than a forecast.</li>
</ul>

<h3>principles</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Occam's Razor</b>: When several theories are able to explain the same observations, Occam's razor suggests the one making the fewest assumptions.</li>
	<li><b>Kolmogorov complexity</b>: The length of the shortest possible program to output a given object.</li>
	<li><b>Kardashev scale</b>: A measure of a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy used for communication.</li>
	<li><b>Levenshtein Distance</b>: A string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences, or comparing the similarity of two words.</li>
	<li><b>Bechdel test</b>: A method for evaluating the portrayal of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man.</li>
	<li><b>Finkbeiner test</b>: A checklist proposed to help journalists avoid gender bias in media articles about women in science.</li>
	<li><b>Ship of Theseus</b>: A thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.</li>
	<li><b>Goodhart’s law</b>: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</li>
	<li><b>Cargo Cult</b>: When you follow the instructions but don’t understand the process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>aeropunk</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Compressed Air Energy Storage</b>: A way to store energy generated at one time for use at another time using compressed air.</li>
	<li><b>Carbon Fiber Tank</b>: Brittle and can split under sufficient stress, but creates no shrapnel when it does so. Carbon-fiber tanks safely hold air at a pressure somewhere around 4500 psi, making them comparable to steel tanks.</li>
	<li><b>Stirling Engine</b>: A quiet heat engine that is operated by a cyclic compression and expansion and a flywheel, generating no emissions.</li>
	<li><b>The Paris Compressed Air Power Network</b>: The city of Paris once had an extensive network for distributing power by compressed air which served more than 10,000 customers and remained in use for 100 years.</li>
	<li><b>Bicycle With Shaft</b>: Experimental bicyle design that used a shaft connecting the crank to the back wheel instead of a drive chain.</li>
	<li><b>Rectenna</b>: A circuit that produces a voltage by harvesting the energy from the electromagnetic fields around us trough an antenna.</li>
	<li><b>Flettner ship</b>: A rotor ship is a type of ship designed to use a rotor sail mounted with its axis vertical. When the wind blows from the side, the Magnus effect creates a forward thrust.</li>
	<li><b>Magnus Effect</b>: The Magnus effect is a force acting on a spinning body in a moving airstream, which acts perpendicular to both the direction of the airstream and of the rotor axis.</li>
	<li><b>Thermoelectric generator</b>: A device that converts temperature differences directly into electrical energy through the Seebeck effect.</li>
</ul>
