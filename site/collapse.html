All around us are signs that our way of living is already passing into history.</h2><p>The concept of liminality applied as a term for thinking about modern societies is connected to the study of theatre and performance. The <i>liminal</i> experiences of tribal cultures – in which ritual is a collective process for navigating moments of change – are different from the <i>liminoid</i> experiences available in modern societies, which resemble the liminal, but are choices we opt into as individuals, like a night out at the theatre. This distinction comes with a suggestion that true liminality, the collective entry into the liminal, is not available within a complex industrial society.</p><p>Perhaps this has been true. The consequences of that very complex industrial society are now bringing us to a point where we get reacquainted with true liminality. We begin to recognise that we now face a crisis which has no outside. The planetary scale of our predicament makes it as much a collective experience as anything faced by the tribal cultures.<a href='https://dark-mountain.net/2016-you-want-it-darker/' target='_blank'>~</a></p><q>Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.</q><h5>—Clay Shirky</h5><h3>collapsology</h3><ul><li><b>Uncivilisation</b>: It is to accept the world for what it is and to make our home here, rather than dreaming of relocating to the stars, or existing in a Man-forged bubble and pretending to ourselves that there is nothing outside it to which we have any connection at all.</li><li><b>Dark Mountaineers</b>: Artists who generally ascribe to the idea that climate collapse cannot be stopped or reversed, a forum in which one can be honest about their sense of dread and loss.</li><li><b>Inhumanism</b>: A shifting of emphasis and significance from man to not-man, the rejection of human solipsism and recognition of the transhuman magnificence.</li><li><b>Anthropocene</b>: A proposed epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change.</li><li><b>Simple pastoral</b>: Merely another of our many vehicles of escape from reality, that doesn’t interrogate civilisation's main driving forces, but instead focuses on returning to rural simplicity.</li><li><b>Object Oriented Ontology</b>: A school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects, that objects exist independently of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans.</li><li><b>Freudian death drive</b>: The hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state.</li><li><b>Agrilogistics paradox</b>: A maniacal urge to live, and to diminish stimulation, that ends up being self-destructive, generating mass extinction, through global warming, that it was designed to avoid.</li><li><b>Existential Risk</b>: An event that could cause human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanity's potential.</li><li><b>Feedback Loops</b>: The results of global warming are complex.
