<main><h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from
permaculture.</h2>

<p>Permacomputing encourages the maximization of hardware lifespan, minimization
of energy usage and focuses on the use of already available computational
resources. It values maintenance and refactoring of systems to keep them
efficient, instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>,
permacomputing practices <a href='salvage_computing.html'>planned
longevity</a>. It is about using computation only when it has a strengthening
effect on ecosystems.</p>

<p id='disassembly'><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of
a product can be disassembled for repair and for <i>end
of life</i>. This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a
product's life cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken
apart at the end of its life so that each component can be reclaimed. </p>

<q>That which cannot be repaired is already broken.</q>

<p>This means using simple mechanical fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling
components with their material type, and ensuring components can be
disassembled with everyday tools. Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a
<i>sustainable</i> product, designing a product for disassembly is a more
concrete, quantifiable approach to ecologically sound making and to
consumption. </p>

<h3>Articulating the Value of Absence</h3>

<p>There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs,
advised by the concepts of permacomputing, and personalized systems to address
those needs, but there are no permacomputing products. Permacomputing is
concerned about finding these limits, and <b>not their artifacts</b>.</p>

<p>Computation is intrinsically <b>self-obviating</b>, which is to mean that the
computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less necessary
to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to provide for
their own welfare.</p>

<h2>Figuring out how to make the best possible use out of the millions of
devices which already exist.</h2>

<p>Salvage computing believes that the end of a computer product's lifecycle
should be seen as a moment of celebration, a moment when its socioeconomic
context can finally be reclaimed. Scavenge-friendly electronics are parts that
are no longer manufactured, but that are available by the billions in
landfills. Those who can manage to create new designs from scavenged parts with
low-tech tools will be able to preserve electronics.</p>

<p>It does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating for a
dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenuity to
turn problems into solutions, competition into co-operation and <a
href='solarpunk.html'>waste into resources</a>.</p>

<p id="encapsulation"><b>Design for Encapsulation</b>: In order to ensure that,
for example, a README file will be readable by any user, distribution disks
include a simple text-editing program that can display the README file. Though
most users already have one on their systems, software vendors should not to
assume that this will be the case.</p>

<article>
	<p>When a file is compressed using PKZIP, a decompression program, such as
PKUNZIP, is required to expand the file. However, an option in PKZIP allows a
simple version of an unzip program to be bundled with each compressed file.
Choosing this option creates an executable file which, when run, expands
automatically to the original file, avoiding the issue of whether the recipient
of a compressed file will have the appropriate decompression software on
hand.</p>

<q>Any sufficiently organized Piracy is indistinguishable from Preservation.</q>

<p><b>Emulation</b> is a way of preserving the functionality and access to
digital information which might otherwise be lost due to technological <a
href='obsolescence.html'>obsolescence</a>. One of the benefits of the emulation
strategy compared with migration is that the original data need not be altered
in any way. It is the emulation of the computer environment that will change
with time. </p>

<p>A <b>universal virtual computer</b> needs to be well documented, contain a
bare minimum of functionality, be easily testable for compliance, and have
very, very few special cases in the specification, since special cases are
opportunities for incompatibility; but despite that, it needs to be a
reasonable target to write a compiler for. Finally, I argue that a UVC ought to
have predictable performance.</p>

<p>Software is <b>bootstrappable</b> when it does not depend on a binary seed that
cannot be built from source. Software that is not bootstrappable, even if it
is free software, is a serious security risk. The goal is to start from a
minimal, easily inspectable binary which should be readable as
source and bootstrap into a practical user interface.</p>

<p>A build is <b>reproducible</b> if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit identical copies of all specified artifacts. To accomplish this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The build system needs to be made entirely deterministic. Transforming a given source must always create the same result. For example, the current date and time must not be recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.</li>
	<li>The set of tools used to perform the build and more generally the build environment should either be recorded or pre-defined.</li>
	<li>Users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build environment, perform the build process, and validate that the output matches the original build.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating may be something we are only able to do, not something we can
describe or understand. For this reason, technology must always play a
secondary role to the creation we wish to embody in our preserved records and
our preserved documents. It would be better to lose everything we have
recorded, and all of our technology, than to suffer even the slightest
diminution in our ability to create. </p>

<h2>Taking advantage of today's abundance in computing power to prepare for a
future in which infrastructures have collapsed.</h2>

<p>Collapse computing prioritizes <b>community needs</b> and aims to contribute
to a knowledge commons in order to sustain the practice of computation through
<a href='collapse.html'>infrastructure collapse</a>, it is the practice of
engaging with the discarded with an eye to transform what is exhausted and
wasted into renewed resources. </p>

<h3>Failure Scenarios</h3>

<ul>
	<li><b>Supply</b>: Difficulty to get new devices and peripherals because
new ones are no longer produced, or unavailable.</li>
	<li><b>Power</b>: Access to power is intermittent, or routed to address
more critical needs than powering computers.</li>
	<li><b>Connectivity</b>: Access to the internet is intermittent due to degraded
infrastructure, or prohibited for geopolitical reasons.</li>
	<li><b>Obsolecence</b>: Inoperability due to undocumented or incompatible
peripherals and software.</li>
	<li><b>Planned Obsolesence</b>: Inoperability from expiring certificates, copy
protection, or other artificial means.</li>

<p id='descent'><b>Designing for Descent</b> ensures that a system is resilient to
intermittent energy supply and network connectivity. Nothing new needs
producing and no e-waste needs processing. If your new software no longer runs
on old hardware, it is <a href='obsolescence.html'>worse</a> than the old
software. Software should function on existing hardware and rely on modularity
in order to enable a diversity of combinations and implementations. It is about
reinventing essential tools so that they are accessible, scalable, sturdy,
modular, easy to repair and well documented.</p>
