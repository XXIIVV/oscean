<main><h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from
permaculture.</h2>

<p>Permacomputing encourages the maximization of hardware lifespan, minimization
of energy usage and focuses on the use of already available computational
resources. It values maintenance and refactoring of systems to keep them
efficient, instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>,
permacomputing practices <a href='salvage_computing.html'>planned
longevity</a>. It is about using computation only when it has a strengthening
effect on ecosystems.</p>

<p id='disassembly'><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of
a product can be disassembled for repair and for <i>end

<q>That which cannot be repaired is already broken.</q>

<p>This means using simple mechanical fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling
components with their material type, and ensuring components can be

<h3>Articulating the Value of Absence</h3>

<p>There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs,
advised by the concepts of permacomputing, and personalized systems to address
those needs, but there are no permacomputing products. Permacomputing is
concerned about finding these limits, and <b>not their artifacts</b>.</p>

<img

	alt='Flower drawn with simple geometric shapes.'

/>
<p>Computation is intrinsically <b>self-obviating</b>, which is to mean that the
computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less necessary
to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to provide for
their own welfare.</p>

<h2>Open computation that goes beyond open source, made from parts designed to
be recombined.</h2>

<p>Every layer of a malleable computing system is designed to support arbitrary
recombination, reused across environments and freely sharable with
others. Modifying such a system happens in the context of use, rather than
through some separate tool and skill set.</p>

<p>In contrast with monolithic applications, these amorphous computers are
finely tuned and thoughtfully crafted by their operator over the course of a
practice.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/super_chair.png'/>

<p>At its core, a malleable system is made of heterogeneous parts capable of
assemblage. Within the context of computation, it is an attribute shared by
different interoperable systems, not unlike programs that communicate via <a
href='unix.html#pipes'>unix pipes</a>, file browsers and some flow-based
programming environments.</p>

<center>
	<img src='../media/refs/pipe.png' style='width:75%'/>
</center>

<p>A malleable part is a transformer in a chain of transformers, and is itself
also made of equally interconnected links, nodes or agents. The more malleable
a system, the blurrier the distinction in the granularity of these parts.</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><th colspan="4" style="text-align:center">Malleability</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:black;color:white">Silo</td>
		<td>A system in which nodes will forcefully captures the message is a <b>silo</b>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#a0ffa0;color:black">Shallow</td>
		<td>Messages can enter and leave a system that is not malleable itself,
this is malleability of a superficial kind.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#4fdd9a;color:black">Average</td>
		<td>Messages can flow freely between internal nodes of a malleable system, but
capabilities are restricted by domain, interface, or operator competency.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#47c199;color:black">Deep</td>
		<td>Messages can be passed seamlessly across every level of the system, the
division into <i>layers</i> has entirely vanished.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>A potential advantage to this granularity is the distribution of complexity so
that an operator can more gently transition toward a deeper understanding of
the finer parts that makes up the solution to a problem.</p>

<p><b>Designing for reversibility</b> is to make a system
approachable to a wide range of competency, lower the cost of errors, and
limit the blame put upon its operator, by favoring transformations that can be
undone.</p>

<p>Some automata conserve enough state through their transformation that
computation can happen backward, without cluttering large amount of memory with
<i>screenshots</i>.</p>

<center>
	<img src='../media/refs/pipe_both.png' style='width:75%'/>
</center>

<p>Familiar examples of reversible computation are the multiplication of a number
by a <a href='fractions.html'>fraction</a> and using the reciprocal to recover
that number, or the stack machine operation <i>rot</i>. The bitwise operator
<i>not</i> or the stack machine <i>swap</i> are <a
href='reversible_computing.html'>involutive</a>, which means that
same operator can applied once again to recover the earlier state.</p>

<p><b>Designing for concatenation</b> is using a point-free message passing
paradigm that does not identify the arguments on which it operates. It is
mentioned here as it might prove valuable in a <i>Deeply Malleable</i> system
as a way to combined both inspectability down to its the mechanical
transformation, and reasonable evaluation performance.</p>

<pre>
: SQUARED ( n -- n^2 ) DUP * ;
: CUBED ( n -- n^3 ) DUP SQUARED * ;
</pre>

<p>In such a system, nodes merely compose other nodes, among which are
combinators that manipulate the arguments, <i>regardless of context</i>. This is
a fancy way of saying that a concatenative sub-expression can be replaced with a
<b>name</b> that represents that same sub-expression.</p>

<pre>
: POPCNT ( n -- bits ) 0 swap
BEGIN dup WHILE tuck 1 AND + swap 1 rshift REPEAT
DROP ;
</pre>

<p>A maximally accessible system such that the finer details in movement of bits
are observable but that does not run on generic hardware would be paradoxical by
virtue of its inaccessibility. For that reason, depending on the host computer,
a function definition like the one above(which might exist as a single opcode),
should probably still be part of the observable system definitions even if it
is not evaluated.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/micr.png' width='120px'/>

<p><b>Designing for differences</b> is to consider the compatibility between
wildly different interfaces and notations to support networks of people
collaborating, across many levels of competency, to make software work for
themselves and their communities.</p>

<p>The rewriting language <a
href='https://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/maude1/manual/maude-manual-html/maude-manual_31.html'
target='_blank'>Maude</a>, uses a <i>mixfix notation</i>, making the system
neither prefix, infix, or postfix, but adaptable to the user's needs and
background. To demonstrate something akin to the mixfix notation and give a
taste of rewriting, consider a <a href='modal.html'>system made of rules</a> where a given <i>left-hand
side</i> is replaced by its corresponding <i>right-hand side</i>, and where
<code>?words</code> will match anything.</p>

<pre>
(add ?x ?y) -> (?x + ?y)
(?x ?y add) -> (?x + ?y)

((?a) + ?b) -> (?a + (?b))
(0 + ?b) -> (sum ?b)
</pre>
<pre style='margin-top:-29px'>
(add 1 2)
</pre>

<img src='../media/refs/ma.png' style='float:right; margin-left:30px; width:100px'/>

<p>The first two rules of the program above both enable the translation between
prefix & postfix, to the infix notation, as well as transcribing the english
symbol <code>add</code> that could otherwise be localized. This is to demonstrate that inter op between
vastly different systems is possible.</p>

<p><b>Designing for bootstrapping</b> is to make a system which does not depend on a binary seed that
cannot be built from source. The goal is to start from a
minimal, easily inspectable binary which should be readable as
source and bootstrap into a practical and reproducible user interface. A build is <i>reproducible</i> if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit identical copies of all specified artifacts. To accomplish this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The build system needs to be made entirely deterministic. Transforming a given source must always create the same result. For example, the current date and time must not be recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.</li>
	<li>The set of tools used to perform the build and more generally the build environment should either be recorded or pre-defined.</li>
	<li>Users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build environment, perform the build process, and validate that the output matches the original build.</li>

<h2>Figuring out how to make the best possible use out of the millions of
devices which already exist.</h2>

<p>Salvage computing believes that the end of a computer product's lifecycle
should be seen as a moment of celebration, a moment when its socioeconomic
context can finally be reclaimed. Scavenge-friendly electronics are parts that
are no longer manufactured, but that are available by the billions in
landfills. Those who can manage to create new designs from scavenged parts with
low-tech tools will be able to preserve electronics.</p>

<p>It does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating for a
dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenuity to
turn problems into solutions, competition into co-operation and <a

<p id="encapsulation"><b>Design for Encapsulation</b>: In order to ensure that,
for example, a README file will be readable by any user, distribution disks
include a simple text-editing program that can display the README file. Though
most users already have one on their systems, software vendors should not to
assume that this will be the case.</p>

<article>
	<p>When a file is compressed using PKZIP, a decompression program, such as
PKUNZIP, is required to expand the file. However, an option in PKZIP allows a
simple version of an unzip program to be bundled with each compressed file.
Choosing this option creates an executable file which, when run, expands
automatically to the original file, avoiding the issue of whether the recipient
of a compressed file will have the appropriate decompression software on
hand.</p>

<q>Any sufficiently organized Piracy is indistinguishable from Preservation.</q>

<p><b>Emulation</b> is a way of preserving the functionality and access to
digital information which might otherwise be lost due to technological <a
href='obsolescence.html'>obsolescence</a>. One of the benefits of the emulation
strategy compared with migration is that the original data need not be altered
in any way. It is the emulation of the computer environment that will change
with time. </p>

<img src='../media/refs/cone.jpg'/>

<p>A <b>universal virtual computer</b> needs to be well documented, contain a
bare minimum of functionality, be easily testable for compliance, and have
very, very few special cases in the specification, since special cases are
opportunities for incompatibility; but despite that, it needs to be a
reasonable target to write a compiler for. Finally, I argue that a UVC ought to
have predictable performance.</p>

<p>Creating may be something we are only able to do, not something we can
describe or understand. For this reason, technology must always play a
secondary role to the creation we wish to embody in our preserved records and
our preserved documents. It would be better to lose everything we have
recorded, and all of our technology, than to suffer even the slightest
diminution in our ability to create. </p>
