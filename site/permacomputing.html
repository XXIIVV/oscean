<main><h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from
permaculture.</h2>

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion
in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements
for computing even the most trivial tasks. Permacomputing aims at only using
computing when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems.</p>

<p>Permacomputing does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite
advocating a dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human
ingenuity to finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions,
competition into co-operation, and <a href='solarpunk.html'>waste into
resources</a></p>

<p>It values maintenance and encourages the refactoring of programs to keep them
efficient, instead of counting on Moore's law to compensate for <a
href='stack.html'>software bloat</a>. Instead of <a
href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>, permacomputing practices <a href='http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html'
target='_blank'>planned longevity</a>, reuse and repair of existing technology and
approaches waste as a resource.</p>

<h3>Articulating the value of absence</h3>

<p>Computation in this context is intrinsically <b>self-obviating</b>, which is to mean
that the computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less
necessary to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to
provide for their own welfare.</p>

<p>It is telling of the age in which we live, that some will find themselves
shopping for the <i>most permacomputing</i> apps to download or computers to
buy. There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs,
and personalized systems to address those needs, but these are by no means
"permacomputing products". Permacomputing is concerned about finding these
limits, and not their artifacts.</p>

<h2>Figuring out how to make the best possible use out of the millions of
devices which already exist.</h2>

<p>Salvage computing believes that the end of a computer product's lifecycle
should be seen as a moment of celebration, a moment when its socioeconomic
context can finally be reclaimed. Scavenge-friendly electronics are parts that
are no longer manufactured, but that are available by the billions in
landfills. Those who can manage to create new designs from scavenged parts with
low-tech tools will be able to preserve electronics.</p>

<p><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of a product can
be disassembled for repair and for <a href='commodity.html'>end of life</a>.
This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a product's life
cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken apart at the end of
its life so that each component can be reclaimed. Among other shifts in
thinking and making, this means minimizing materials, using simple mechanical
fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling components with their material
type, and ensuring components can be disassembled with everyday tools. </p>

<q>That which cannot be repaired is already broken.</q>

<p>Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a <i>sustainable</i> product, designing
a product for disassembly is a more concrete, quantifiable approach to
ecologically sound making and to consumption. <a

<p><b>Emulation</b> is a way of preserving the functionality and access to
digital information which might otherwise be lost due to technological <a
href='obsolescence.html'>obsolescence</a>. One of the benefits of the emulation
strategy compared with migration is that the original data need not be altered
in any way. It is the emulation of the computer environment that will change
with time. </p>

<p>A <b>universal virtual computer</b> needs to be well documented, contain a
bare minimum of functionality, be easily testable for compliance, and have
very, very few special cases in the specification, since special cases are
opportunities for incompatibility; but despite that, it needs to be a
reasonable target to write a compiler for. Finally, I argue that a UVC ought to
have predictable performance.</p>

<h2>Taking advantage of today's abundance in computing power to prepare for a
future in which infrastructures have collapsed.</h2>

<p>Collapse computing prioritizes <b>community needs</b> and aims to contribute
to a knowledge commons in order to sustain the practice of computation through
<a href='collapse.html'>infrastructure collapse</a>, it is the practice of
engaging with the discarded with an eye to transform what is exhausted and
wasted into renewed resources. </p>

<p>A post-collapse society that has eventually lost all of its artificial
computing capacity may still want to continue the practice of computer science
for various reasons.</p>

<p><b>Designing for Descent</b> ensures that a system is resilient to
intermittent energy supply and network connectivity. Nothing new needs
producing and no e-waste needs processing. If your new software no longer runs
on old hardware, it is <a href='obsolescence.html'>worse</a> than the old
software. Software should function on existing hardware and rely on modularity
in order to enable a diversity of combinations and implementations. It is about
reinventing essential tools so that they are accessible, scalable, sturdy,
modular, easy to repair and well documented.</p>
