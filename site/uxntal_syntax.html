<main><h2>Uxntal Syntax</h2>

<p>In <a href='concatenative.html' target='_blank'>concatenative programming</a>, there are no precedence rules,
the calculations are merely performed in the sequence in which they are
presented. The order with which elements come off a stack is known as <b>last
in, first out</b>. In the stack <i>a b c</i>, the <i>c</i> item was the last to
be added, and will be the first to be removed.</p>

<pre>
#01 DUP ADD #03 MUL <i>( result: 06 )</i>
</pre>

<p>Parentheses indicate comments, lowercase #numbers are <a
href='hexadecimal.html'>hexadecimal</a> literals to be pushed onto the stack.</p>

<h3>Example Program</h3>

<p>The first line of our example begins with the padding token <kbd>|10</kbd>,
followed by definitions for <kbd>@labels</kbd>, <kbd>&sublabels</kbd> and
<kbd>$length</kbd> that aligns with the various ports of the <a
href='varvara.html#console'>Console device</a> so that we can reference it by
name in our program. To learn more, see <a href='uxntal_struct.html'>Uxntal
Structs</a>.</p>

<article>
	<p>The following program is <b>not the most efficient way</b> of printing a
string, merely a length of code that covers most basic functionalities of the
language.</p>
</article>

<iframe src="../etc/uxnrepl/index.html" frameborder="0" class='frame'></iframe>

<style>
.example span.label { font-weight: bold;background: #fff;color: #000;padding: 2px 4px; }
.example span.comment { color:#777 }
.frame { overflow: hidden; height: 450px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius:5px }
</style>

<p>The second segment moves the program location to the address 0x0100, which is
where the first page of memory ends, and <a href='uxntal_memory.html'>where all
Uxn programs begin</a>. Next, inside parentheses, is a <b>comment</b> with the
arrow symbol indicating that the following operation is a vector. To learn
more, see <a href='uxntal_notation.html'>Uxntal Notation</a>.</p>

<p>The <kbd>;my-string</kbd> token pushes an <b>absolute address</b>, made of
two bytes, pointing to a series of letters in memory. Values
pushed to the stack in this fashion are called a <i>literals</i>, as opposed to
values stored in memory which are called <i>immediates</i>. Next, we call the
<kbd>@print-text</kbd> routine.</p>

<p>Both <kbd>&while</kbd> and <kbd>@while</kbd> are ways to define <b>labels</b>,
but using the ampersand rune will prefix our new label with the name of the
last parent label, creating <kbd>@print-text/while</kbd>. To learn more, see <a
href='uxntal_scope.html'>Uxntal Scope</a>.</p>

<p>Next, the <a href='uxntal_opcodes.html#lda'><kbd>LDAk</kbd></a> opcode loads
the byte in memory found at that address; the <a href='ascii.html'>ASCII</a>
letter H, to the top of the stack. The <a href='uxntal_modes.html'>k-mode</a>
indicates that the operation will not consume the address. That value is sent
to the <a href='varvara.html#console'>device port #18</a>, defined by our
Console label and its sublabels, with <a
href='uxntal_opcodes.html#deo'><kbd>DEO</kbd></a> which prints that character
to the terminal. To learn more, see <a
href='uxntal_devices.html'>Uxntal Devices</a>.</p>

<p>We then increment the absolute address found on top of the stack with <a
href='uxntal_opcodes.html#inc'><kbd>INC2</kbd></a>, we use the <a
href='uxntal_modes.html'>2-mode</a> because the address is made of two bytes.
We load the byte at the incremented value and do a conditional immediate jump
with <kbd>?&while</kbd> for as long as the item on the stack is not zero. We
use <a href='uxntal_opcodes.html#pop'><kbd>POP2</kbd></a> to remove the address
on the stack and keep the stack clean at the end of the subroutine.</p>

<p>Lastly, we encounter <a href='uxntal_opcodes.html#jmp'><kbd>JMP2r</kbd></a>
which jumps to the absolute address that we left on the return stack when we
entered the <kbd>@print-text</kbd> subroutine.</p>

<img src="../media/generic/uxn.team.png" style="margin:0 auto 30px" width="300">

<p>To summarize, uppercased opcodes are reserved words, lowercase hexadecimal
numbers are bytes and shorts, parentheses are <a
href='uxntal_notation.html'>comments</a>, curlies are <a
href='uxntal_lambdas.html'>lambdas</a>, and square brackets are used for
organization. Runes are special characters at the start of a word that define
its meaning, here is the full list:</p>

</table><h2>Using inline functions in Uxntal.</h2>

<p>A macro is a way of defining inline routines, it allows to create new words that will be replaced by the body of the macro, as opposed to a jump where the program counter will move to a routine and back, therefore it needs to be defined before its usage, as follow: </p>

<pre>
%modulo ( num denum -- res ) {
	DIVk MUL SUB
}

@routine ( -- c* )
	#18 #03 modulo
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>In the previous example, the token <kbd>modulo</kbd> will get replaced by the body of the macro during assembly:</p>

<pre>
@routine ( -- c* )
	#18 #03 DIVk MUL SUB
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> A macro does not have a <a href='uxntal_scope.html'>scope</a>, so it may not contain sublabels if the macro is to be used multiple time within a single parent label, <a href='uxntal_lambdas.html'>lambdas</a> are immune to this limitation.</p><h2>Using and defining data structures in Uxntal.</h2>

<p><b>Enums</b> are labels with unique values that can be used as constants in a
program, they begin by rolling back the program address with
<kbd>|00</kbd>:</p>

<pre>
|00 @Suit &clubs $1 &diamonds $1 &hearts $1 &spades

@is-diamond ( suit -- f )
	.Suit/clubs EQU
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p><b>Structs</b> define padded labels, for example the <code>;person/age</code>
label holds a value of 2, using that offset allows to access specific members
of a data structure by applying the sublabels to a pointer:</p>

<pre>
|00 @Person &name $2 &age $1 &height $2
@members
	=dict/melanye 2a 008c
	=dict/alexane 2c 009a

@get-height ( member* -- height* )
	;Person/height ADD2 LDA2
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p><b>Constants</b> are labels that hold a specific value through the entire execution of the program. They allow to create label that can be used in place of a number, making the code more readable.</p>

<pre>
|1400 @limit

@within-limit ( value* -- f )
	;limit LTH2
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p><b>Pro Tip</b>: Labels can also be used with the padding runes to define a
global length. For example, if one needs to specify a length of 0x30 for multiple
members of a struct, a value can be specified as follow:</p>

<pre>
|30 @length
|00 @struct &field $length
</pre>
<h2>Using and defining scope in Uxntal.</h2>

<p>Uxntal objects are defined statically using a <kbd>@label</kbd> token, it allows for the enclosed methods to access local <kbd>&labels</kbd>. The example below creates an object with the method <kbd>get-x</kbd>, accessible from outside the scope as <kbd>Object/get-x</kbd>. By capitalizing the object name, we communicate to the assembler that the label will not be called and should not raise a warning.</p>

<pre>
@Object

&x $1 &y $1

&get-x <i>( -- x )</i>
	,&x LDR
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>New methods and members can be appended to an existing scope by creating a label with the scope name followed by a slash and the name of the extension. The <kbd>&labels</kbd> declared within the extension have the same permissions for accessing local labels as during the object definition. To learn more, see <a href='symbols.html'>symbols</a>.</p>

<pre>
@Object/get-y <i>( -- y )</i>
	,&y LDR
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>When calling local routines the scope's name can be omitted. To see a complete example in that pseudo object-oriented style, see <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/main/item/projects/examples/gui/timer.tal' target='_blank'>timer.tal</a>.</p>

<pre>
&get-both <i>( -- x y )</i>
	Object/get-x 
	/get-y
	JMP2r
</pre>
<h2>Using stack effect definitions in Uxntal.</h2>

<p>The Uxntal notation follows that of the <a href='forth.html'>Forth</a>
programming language, where each item on the left of the <kbd>--</kbd> spacer
is the state of the stack before, and to the right, the state of the stack
after:</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b -- a b c )
	ADDk
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>By default, single items are a byte long, and shorts are indicated with a
<kbd>*</kbd> suffix, the order in which they appear is the order of the stack
with the top item to the right:</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b* -- b* a )
	ROT
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>In some rare cases, an item is passed to a routine via the return stack, in
this case it is prefixed with the <kbd>`</kbd> character indicates items in the
return stack to its right. The return address is omitted from the stack effect
notation.</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a* `b* -- )
	POP2 POP2r
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>If a specific item on the stack needs to be explicit about it being a pointer
that needs to be unquoted, the concatenative notation is written within square
brackets.</p>

<pre>
@routine ( {fn}* -- )
	JMP2
</pre>

<p>Further notation is available for <a href='uxntal_types.html'>program
verification</a>.</p>

<h2>Using anonymous functions in Uxntal</h2>

<p>In the context of Uxntal, lambdas is a label designated by a curly bracket
that points to its associated closing bracket, and can be nested. Under the
hood, the opening bracket assembles to the address of the closing bracket which
allows the destination address to be used like any other label such as a JCI
<kbd>?{</kbd>, a JMI, <kbd>!{</kbd> or a plain literal <kbd>;{</kbd>. </p>

<h3>Counted Strings</h3>
<p>Similarly to counted strings, lambdas can encode strings in memory by preceeding their content by the address of the end of the string, so the reading of that string data is not looking for a null byte, but running until reaching the bounds. The advantage is that the address of the next character to append is readily available.</p>

<pre>
@on-reset ( -> )
    ;cstr print-counted
    BRK

@cstr ={ "foo 20 "bar }

@print-counted ( cstr* -- )
    LDA2k SWP2 INC2 INC2
    &l ( -- )
        LDAk #18 DEO
        INC2 GTH2k ?&l
    POP2 POP2 JMP2r
</pre>

<h3>Data Structures</h3>

<p>We can inline a list of items, here's an implementation a function that
returns the member in a list, or <i>nil</i>. Notice how the lambda jump requires the list address to be moved from the return stack.</p>

<pre>
{ =cat =dog =bat } STH2r ;rat member?
</pre>

<pre>
@member? ( {items}* target* -- res* )
	,&t STR2
	DUP2k #0002 SUB2 LDA2 ADD2 SWP2
	&l ( -- )
		LDA2k [ LIT2 &t $2 ] EQU2 ?&found
		INC2 INC2 GTH2k ?&l
	POP2 ;nil &found NIP2
	JMP2r
</pre>

<h3>Unless Blocks</h3>

<p>It is important to notice that a in the case of a conditional jump, the
lambda's content is <b>jumped over when the flag byte is true</b>.</p>

<pre>
.button LDZ ?{ skipped-on-button }
</pre>

<p>Lambdas can also be nested into one another, only the outermost layer of a
nested lambda is evaluated at a time:</p>

<pre>
#01 { { "foo $1 } STH2r !print-lambda } STH2r JCN2
</pre>

<h3>Higher-Order Functions</h3>

<p>A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as an argument or
returns one as a result. In the following example, the foreach routine is
expecting a pointer to a series of bytes, and a pointer to a function to apply
on each byte-long item in memory.</p>

<pre>
{ 01 02 03 04 05 } STH2r ;double foreach
</pre>

<p>The body of the <code>double</code> function reads the value of a cell in
memory and writes a result equal to twice its value, and the body of the
<code>foreach</code> function is merely applying a function to each cell in
memory.</p>

<pre>
@double ( addr* -- addr* )
	STH2k LDAk
	DUP ADD
	STH2r STA
	JMP2r

@foreach ( {bytes}* fn* -- bytes* )
	,&t STR2
	DUP2k #0002 SUB2 LDA2 ADD2 SWP2
	&l ( -- )
		[ LIT2 &t $2 ] JSR2 INC2 GTH2k ?&l
	POP2 POP2
	JMP2r
</pre>


<h2>Uxntal Doors</h2>

<p>The ability to treat instructions as data makes programs that write programs
possible. <b>Self-modifying code</b>(SMC) is generally considered harmful, and is
therefore not permitted in most modern computer architectures today.</p>

<article>
	<p><b>Action at a distance</b> is an anti-pattern in computer science in which
behavior in one part of a program modifies operations in another part of the
program. This anti-pattern should be avoided whenever possible, but if wielded
carefully SMC can become a practical ally when writing Uxntal.</p>
</article>

<p>A door is an allocation of local memory that can store state across
vectors.</p>

<pre>
@routine <i>( -- i )</i>
	[ LIT &door $1 ] INCk ,&door STR
	JMP2r
</pre>

<h3>Caching Doors</h3>

<p>In most cases, SMC is used to cache data that would otherwise be difficult or
slow to retrieve, like when writing a responsive application that would make
frequent requests to a device.</p>

<p>In the following door, we are comparing the state of the mouse device
between vector events, we could store the previous state in a zero-page
variable, but keeping the value locally allows to reserve a byte from within
the context where it is needed, and is faster by being inlined.</p>

<pre>
@on-mouse ( -> )
	[ LIT2 &last $1 -Mouse/state ] DEI 
		DUP ,&last STR
		EORk ?&changed 
	POP2
	BRK</pre>

<h3>Callback Doors</h3>

<p>To chain operations across vectors, one might try passing the next operation
pointer on the stack, but since we cannot be certain which vector will happen
next, we can't expect a specific stack state between events. A safer
way is to write the next operation directly into a door where it will be
needed, ideally preserving the label scope.</p>

<pre>
@set-animation ( callback* -- )
	,&callback STR2
	;&run .Screen/vector DEO2
	JMP2r

&run ( -> )
	[ LIT &time f0 ] 
		INCk ,&time STR
		#00 EQU ?&done
	try-redraw
	BRK

&done ( -> )
	[ LIT2 &callback $2 ] JSR2
	BRK
</pre>

<h3>Depth-Punching Doors</h3>

<p>Routines should try and avoid accessing stack values that are further than 2
or 3 shorts deep on either stacks, but sometimes it cannot be helped. In the
following example, we want to run a function over each value of a 2d array.
Instead of juggling the stacks on each iteration to bring out the function
pointer, it is often more efficient to write the function pointer across the
nested loop.</p>

<pre>
@each-pixel ( fn* -- )
	,&fn STR2
	#1000
	&h
		STHk
		#2000
		&x
			DUP STHkr [ LIT2 &fn $2 ] JSR2
			INC GTHk ?&x
		POP2
		POPr
		INC GTHk ?&h
	POP2
	JMP2r
</pre>

<h2>Using and operating on negative numbers in Uxntal.</h2>

<p>Uxn doesn't have built-in support for negative integers. However, you can
emulate <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations'
target='_blank'>signed numbers</a> by treating some unsigned values as
negative. For example, treating unsigned bytes as signed results in the
following:</p>

<table border='1' style='font-family:monospace'>
	<tr>
	<th>hex</th>
	<td>00</td><td>01</td><td>02</td>
	<td rowspan='3'></td>
	<td>7e</td><td>7f</td><td><b>80</b></td><td>81</td><td>82</td>
	<td rowspan='3'></td>
	<td>fd</td><td>fe</td><td>ff</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>unsigned</th>
	<td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td>
	<td>126</td><td>127</td><td>128</td><td>129</td><td>130</td>
	<td>253</td><td>254</td><td>255</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>signed</th>
	<td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td>
	<td>126</td><td>127</td><td>-128</td><td>-127</td><td>-126</td>
	<td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The first 128 integers (0-127) are represented the same as unsigned and
signed, but the latter 128 are different. The basic idea here is that for
values greater than #7f (127) we subtract 256 to get their <i>signed value</i>:</p>

<pre>signed = n < 128 ? n : n - 256</pre>

<p>It turns out that many unsigned operations "work" even when treating the values
as signed. (In other words, you get the same result as you would have using a
language with signed integer types.) The following arithmetic instructions work
correctly with "signed" values:</p>

<pre>
#13 #ff ADD returns #12
#02 #03 SUB returns #ff
#02 #ff MUL returns #fe
</pre>

<p>Be careful! The smallest negative value (-128 for bytes, -32768 for shorts)
has no corresponding positive value. This means that some operations will
not work as expected:</p>

<pre>
#80 #ff MUL returns #80 (-128 * -1 = -128)
#00 #80 SUB returns #80 (0 - (-128) = -128)
</pre>

<p>Also, negative and positive values will "wrap around" in the usual way when
dealing with two's-complement representations:</p>

<pre>
#7f #01 ADD returns #80 (127 + 1 = -128)
#80 #01 SUB returns #7f (-128 - 1 = 127)
#80 #80 ADD returns #00 (-128 + (-128) = 0)
</pre>

<p>Other instructions will not handle "negative" integers correctly. These
routines will safely compare "signed" bytes:</p>

<pre>
@signed-lth ( x y -- res )
	DUP2 #8080 AND2 EQU ?&diff LTH JMP2r &diff LTH #00 NEQ JMP2r

@signed-gth ( x y -- res )
	DUP2 #8080 AND2 EQU ?&diff GTH JMP2r &diff GTH #00 NEQ JMP2r
</pre>

<p>Similarly, division will not correctly handle signed values. The simplest
way to handle this is to make both values non-negative, do unsigned
division (i.e. DIV) and then set the correct sign at the end.</p>

<pre>
@abs ( x -- abs-x sign )
	DUP #7f GTH #fe MUL INC STHk MUL STHr JMP2r

@signed-div ( x y -- x/y )
	abs STH SWP abs STH SWP DIV MULr STHr MUL JMP2r
</pre>

<p>The unsigned shift operator treats the sign bit like any other. This means
shifting left will lose the sign bit (reversing the sign) and that shifting
right will convert the sign bit into a value bit. Signed numbers will also need
their own routines for decimal input and output, if those are required by your
program.</p>

<pre>
@signed-print ( num -- )
	( - ) DUP #80 LTH ?{ LIT "- #18 DEO #7f AND #80 SWP SUB }
	( 100 ) DUP #64 DIV signed-print/emit
	( 10 ) DUP #0a DIV signed-print/base
	&base ( digit -- ) #0a DIVk MUL SUB
	&emit ( digit -- ) LIT "0 ADD #18 DEO JMP2r
</pre>

<p>If you need a sign-aware shift you'll likely want to convert negatives to
positive values, perform a shift, and then restore the sign. Keep in mind
that -128 cannot be converted to a positive value, and may require special
treatment.</p>
