	<h2>2025-07-28 Workout Routine</h2>
	<p>I've received a few messages asking about workout plans, and
like I've said before, I am the last person you want to take advice from. I'm
merely writing these down for the sake of being able to look back on what I
tried. My aim in all this is to build just enough upperbody strength so that I
can do a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle-up'
target='_blank'>muscle-up</a> when spring rolls in. Unless you're
already somewhat deep into your calisthenics journey, I wouldn't try
replicating any of this.</p>
	<p>We're already a few weeks deep into summer, so I want to look back at how
working out aboard actually <i>worked out</i>. Our life aboard has been much
too chaotic to allow for any kind of pattern, so I can't say that I've
developed anything like a routine, but these are the predictably recurring
exercises that I've enjoyed doing every single day:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rowing: 10min.</li>
		<li>Dips: 1x10.</li>
		<li>Dead-Hang: 2x60sec.</li>
		<li>Pull Ups: 1x10, 2x5.</li>
		<li>Hand Grippers: 10x50lb, 10x100lb, 5x150lb.</li>

	<h2>2025-07-01 Tent</h2>
	<p>A couple of months ago, on the train to Strange Loop, I had the good
fortune of sharing a cabin with Anders, whom I had just met and who
shared with me a way of guessing at the correct settings for shooting with a
broken light meter using a technique called <i>Sunny-16</i>. Unfortunately, by
the time I had made it back home, I couldn't recall how it all worked.</p>
	<p>I just spent the past few days anchored by Blakely Island, wandering into the
woods holding old <a href='film.html'>film</a> cameras with a few friends, 
which I am now gladly counting Anders among them who spent
time with me to go through the motion once again using my own Voightlander and
its broken light meter.</p>
	<p><b>Sunny-16</b> goes something like this: At f-16, with the shutter speed at
about roughly the film speed, should turn up a good picture on a sunny clear
day. From there, one can work their way down the f-stops, so that at the speed
of the film, f-8 would be a cloudy day, f-4 an indoors picture, and so on.</p>

	<h2>2025-06-09 Working Out</h2>
	<p>Before casting off from Victoria, we wondered if it'd be enjoyable, or even
safe to work out aboard Pino. It did take a bit of getting used to at first,
but we've eventually both fallen into a daily habit of doing pull ups from the
companionway, dips with the cockpit seats, seated rows by trapping a resistance
band around a winch and lat pulldowns from the boom.</p>
	<p>One of my projects for the next few years is to raise my grip strength enough that
I can reliably close down a 70kg hand gripper, so every evening, I pull out a
book or a video(solar permitting) and do hand exercises for an hour or so.</p>

	<h2>2025-05-24 Cast Off</h2>
	<p>It's happening! I've begun drafting a rough layout for a tentative book
project, for which the working title is currently <i>Turnip Complete</i>. I
don't know if I can actually go through with this idea yet, but I'm going find
out over the summer, and hopefully have something to show in the fall. The idea
would be to have a paper artifact that contains everything that currently makes
up the Uxn/Varvara ecosystem, from implementation details, to language
specification; all from basic principles.</p>
	<p>We're just about ready to cast off from Victoria for the summer, and today was
my last day at the gym. I pushed hard these past few months, and it's beginning
to pay off. The back pains I had are gone, I sleep much better, I feel stronger
and clothes even fit me better. I gained 10kg, and I'm hoping to reach my ideal
weight of 80kg in the next few months. I have plans to work out from aboard <a

it'll be..</p>

	<h2>2025-05-05 For The Future</h2>
	<p>Over the years, by haphazardly filling-in missing details to the docs as
questions arose, I've let the <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal language</a> pages
grow into a tangled and overgrown labyrinthine mess that oftener threw folks
into opaque dead-ends than answer questions.</p>

	<p>This week, a pointedly cutting criticism of the Uxn documentation shook me out of
the laissez-faire that I had over these few pages and reminded me how letting
it go the way I did was a disservice to others, but especially myself,
considering that I may be using this tool, possibly for the rest of my
life.</p>

	<p>Since I couldn't clearly discern what should and shouldn't be there, I've
asked for help, and got excellent ideas. With feedback from both new learners
and experienced folks, I rewrote most of the documentation, included new
examples, expanded tests and added setup instructions for both Uxn, and
Varvara.</p>

	<p>Looking at the documentation now, I feel like I would very much like to work
on writing a book about it, to have a paperback artifact in the style of
Henderson's <a href='https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/3299/PRG32%20vol%201.pdf'
target='_blank'>LispKit Manuals</a>. A treatise on the design and
implementation of the system from the bottom up, but plastered with
drawings.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Wrote 10 examples for the revamped <a href='../etc/uxnrepl/index.html'>Uxn REPL</a>.</li>
		<li>Made a graphical version of <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>

	<h2>2025-04-13 Paper Paper Paper</h2>
	<p>I was recently reminded of that paper about how <a

did attempt to fold one of these for myself. I've already written about a <a
href='paper_computer.html'>paper computer</a> and all the ways in which
computer emulators can be operated on paper, but nothing on using the paper
itself for doing the computation. So I set out to correct that, and all the
while learning how to do hexagonal folds for the first time.</p>
	<p>Another thing on my plate has been to gradually getting rid of <a
href='../etc/uxnasm.c.txt'>Uxnasm.c</a> in favor of the <a
href='drifblim.html'>self-hosted one</a>. Before I entirely drop that

	<p>I recently came across Increpare's lovely <a href='https://www.flickgame.org'

game engine in which scenes are navigated based on which color is clicked on. I
didn't see myself using the javascript implementation, and since this elegant
idea was so straightforward, I figured I might as well spend a day to port it
to <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>.</p>
	<p>I took the opportunity to improve things a bit and made it usable on the

	<h2>2025-01-25 Handmade Conference Post-Mortem</h2>
	<p>Some months ago, attendees of the Handmade Seattle conference expressed their
grievances with the conference in regards to its pivoting to include talks with
mentions of social justice awareness and a slightly more diverse panel of
speakers, at the cost of the usual <i>guy-packs-bytes-in-the-right-sequence</i>
talks. Which I have nothing against as someone who tend to give talks of
that exact flavor.</p>
	<p>In any case, the conference organizer apologized for the poor selection of
speakers which did not correspond to the expectations of ticket holders,
promising to resolve the issue in the following year, and in passing, that free
and open source software developers would <a href='https://assets.merveilles.town/media_attachments/files/113/886/295/005/674/393/original/9e6b93f5d01f8c12.mp4' target='_blank'>no longer</a> be welcomed as
speakers.</p>
	<p>I happened to be present in the chatroom when the apology letter went out and
merely questioned whether the choice was really about the lack of
<i>low-level</i> talks, and not something else. It did not take long for
bigots of all sorts to come out and lament the good old days of the conference
and soon the chatroom was ablaze with some pretty vile things against trans
people, this went on for hours without intervention, the usual.</p>
	<p>What I did not expect was for the conference organizer, who ghosted me for
months, to finally break radio silence to slam me for speaking out and
partially blaming me for the unraveling of the conference organization, and
decided against covering the agreed upon travel stipend. I have since
requested for the talk videos to be removed. </p>

	<h2>2025-01-11 Langdev January</h2>
	<p>It has become something of a yearly ritual to take the first few days of the
year to write a new implementation of the <a href='drifblim.html'>compiler</a>
I use daily. It serves to see how my programming style and solutions to these
now familiar problems might have evolved, it also ensures that the language
itself doesn't grow beyond what I am capable of implementing in at most a
week's time.</p>
	<p>The most discernible difference in this new implementation, is that it leans
heavily on <a href='uxntal_labels.html#scope'>object-oriented patterns</a>, by
favoring methods acting on private values, over pointer arithmetic by function
application. The stack is principally used as the communication channel between
objects, for example, a text object's buffer is only ever modified through its
explicitly defined capabilities, not by a function taking a text pointer. It
turns out it limits bugs, it is faster and even often smaller!</p>

<h2>2024</h2>

<p>Finish packing, we're going on an Adventure. Where to? <i>north</i>. North?
But, north where? <a href='https://100r.co/site/us_se_alaska.html'
target='_blank'>North</a>! And with that in mind, we spent the better part of
the Spring loading <a href='pino.htlm'>Pino</a> with enough food, supplies,
warm clothes and spares to sail as far north as we physically could take it,
through difficult waters, harsh weather, in a small vessel with an open
cockpit.</p>

<p>A few improvements later, we slipped off the dock and started our climb up the
coast, all the while attempting to work on whatever could be accomplished with
one hand, while fending off the sideways sleet with the other. Somewhen during
that time I found myself falling deep, <i>way deep</i>, into <a
href='rewriting.html'>rewrite languages</a> and implementing just about every
rewrite system I could sink my teeth into while summer was gradually catching
up with us.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/857.jpg'/>

<p>We didn't found much up there except for moss-blanketed trees, talkative
peanut stealing ravens, erupting whale spray and time, so much <i>time</i>.
Time to read, feed the woodstove, write, doodle, mend clothes, swear at algae
clogging up the water intake, think, look outside even if there's little else
than what I just enumerated other than the occasional bear swimming, loose you mind,
right, at seeing a bear for the first time. But in all, only ever seldomly an
other boat, almost never a sailboat.</p>

<p>Eventually we got fed up with all this debilitating beauty, its black
flies, and started our way back down, all the while writing a lot of <a
href='fractran.html'>fractions</a>, drawing lots of <a
href='neauismetica.html'>characters hanging from the edge of cliffs</a>,
scribbling lots of <a href='https://100r.co/site/shining_sand.html'
target='_blank'>undecipherable slides</a> and reading the occasional <a
href='reading.html'>unforgettable novel</a>.</p>

<p>This exhilarating year ended with a visit to see our families and friends,
and vaguely gesticulating away questions regarding what comes next.</p>

<p>For the year of 2024, Beryl Markham's West With The Night, was my favourite
<a href='reading.html'>book</a>. J. Wickham's Yintah was my favourite <a
href='watching.html'>documentary</a>. Alcest's Les Chants de l'Aurore was my
favourite <a href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

	<p>Back from Seattle, where I had the immense pleasure of sharing a few days
with kind, passionate and most of all <a href='merveilles.html'>wonderful</a>
individuals, some I had crossed paths with already, others, new faces that I am
now looking forward to see once more. Evenings were busied with conversations
that felt as easy as picking up where we might have left off despite not having
seen each other for years, or even when meeting for the first time.</p>
	<p>I was curious to see whether using creative storytelling to give a <a
href='talk.html'>talk</a> about computation would resonate with the Handmade
attendees, fortunately, based on what echoed late into the night within the
halls of the Mediterannean Inn, above tables covered with <a
href='zines.html'>zines</a> and whiteboards ornate with hastily scribbled <a
href='rewriting.html'>rewrite rules</a>, most people <i>got</i> it. I hope that
my loveletter to the work of Borges, Conway and Wryl, will be an invitation to
explore the space of rewriting, while remaining critical of the trajectory of
computing.</p>

	<p>October came and went, ideas piled up in notebooks, but I kept on drawing. I
knew already by the time I had finished the <a
href='pocket_rewriting.html'>Pocket Rewriting</a> zine that I would make a
dynamic implementation of it which, by the way, was very well received despite
my not having even had a chance of giving away a single one. I was delighted to
see folks print their own copies.</p>
	<p>These past two weeks have been a throwback to the release of <a
href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, where the less <i>programmatically inclined</i>
started playing with it right away, and those with preconceptions about what
programming is, what it should look and work like, found it inscrutable and
opaque. To some, the booklet remains near undecipherable. I will try to help
bridge that gap with more approachable documentation and examples over the winter.</p>

	<p>Three weeks! I think that was the longest I went on without writing a single
line of code for the past many years, for even during long transits at sea, I
find time to sneak some in to answer these questions one ponders while gazing
at the horizon. I had other things on my mind this month, slides to finish,
dailies to draw, and settling back in our winter life in Victoria. As of
yesterday, that streak ended.</p>
	<p>For a upcoming event, I wanted to be able to show anyone who
might ask a few simple examples of rewriting computation in a way that would
not be intrusive during a conversation, so I printed a <a

foresee myself repeat over again and having a challenging time doing so without

	<p>The automated weather radio voice drones about the advent of favorable
northerly winds that never manifest, so we've resorted to doing short hops,
weather permitting, between the safety of one inlet and the next whenever the

	<p>The inlets we find ourselves anchored in are worlds of their own with
inhabitants that, as transitory as some may be, are affairing themselves with
happenings that extend to the shores of the lagoon, but no further. A
strange new thing has come into the sheltered water and disrupted its hubbub,
now everyone looks as if caught in a gasp, at its skyward pointing wing, at its
opaque lifelessness. Through the oblong eyes of the vessel, like under a
diving bell, we peer back in wonder.</p>
	<p>There are as many days to our bow without connectivity than those that lay
between our stern and Prince Rupert, where we were last able to make contact.

tinkering, only to return further down the coast, precipitating an emergency
arrival in some questionably-sheltered flies-infested inlet hidden past but a
few jagged rocks that the ocean breakers have as of yet unsuccessfully softened.

	<h2>2024-04-13 String rewrite II</h2>
	<p>Rek and I are completing the remaining projects on our pre-departure list and
provisioning for our sail to <a href='alaska.html'>Alaska</a>. Over the winter,
we've strengthened critical parts aboard <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, replaced
experienced pieces of the rigging and simplified the habitat's life-systems
&mdash; Hopefully, this will all make the journey safer, and dryer.</p>
	<p>After exploring Wryl's <a href='modal.html'>Modal language</a> further, I
decided to write <a href='../etc/modal.c.txt' target='_blank'>an
implementation</a> to better understand how it worked, mechanically. This
sparked a renewed interest from the original creator, attracted members of
catlang community to explore string rewriting and has given me long and
delightful evenings pondering about how to crack various programming problems
with it. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implemented <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/modal' target='_blank'>Modal in ANSI C</a>.</li>
		<li>Wrote <a href='https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Tic-tac-toe' target='_blank'>Tic-tac-toe</a> in it.</li>
		<li>Returned <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/left/commit/bbfd6cf44fd96026f28c0aed1c0ca624a77214a0' target='_blank'>matching parentheses</a> to Left.</li>

	<h2>2024-04-02 String rewrite I</h2>
	<p>We are waiting for a few parts that we had machined, to return to us from the
local fabricator. While we wait, I spend most of time playing with esolangs,
one that has especially interested me lately is <a href='modal.html'>Modal</a>,
which is a simple string-rewriting scheme similar to <i>Thue</i>,
but with the added feature that it allows for variables, and recognizes scope
delimiters. It's a brutally simple idea that allows a program to be shaped as
to mimic nearly any programing paradigm.</p>
	<p>I had been reticent to expanding the <a href='uxntal_macros.html'>Uxntal
macro</a> system because of how it creates disjointed fragments of code that
couldn't be properly optimized, but after talking to people writing programs in
which macros were definitely the right tool for the task, I've decided to
rewrite the implementation and make them more robust. </p>

	<h2>2024-03-21 Catlangs</h2>
	<p>As days are getting warmer, we can begin to tackle some much needed
maintenance topside like changing old lines, varnishing the oars and inspecting
the rigging. After a whole winter of getting up in the dark to do weight
training, I feel it was well worth it as my back pain is gone, I sleep better
and feel more overall physically capable. I have a month left of gym membership
and plan to make use of it as much as I physically can before its expiration,
and our casting off.</p>
	<p>I've spend the idle hours of these past few days improving <a
href='left.html'>Left</a>, thinking about <a
href='concatenative.html'>concatenative programming</a> and trying to better
understand <a
href='https://concatenative.yahoogroups.narkive.com/hrdFdrU7/stack-what-does-actually-mean'
target='_blank'>what makes a language concatenative</a>. To try and answer this
question, I've asked members of the catlang community to add example programs
for the various flavors. One of these examples was the <a
href='https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Tak%20function' target='_blank'>Tak
Function</a> which was new to me, and found it to map surprisingly well to
stack programming.</p>

	<h2>2024-03-10 Left revamp</h2>
	<p>We took <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>'s chainplates off and while the new ones
are being fabricated, we reinforced the area where the chainplate meet the
deck. It makes for a momentarily uninhabitable place to live, so I haven't had
much headspace to do creative work these past few days, but it will be well
worth it considering the places we're hoping to venture into.</p>
	<p>Whenever I get to reclaim my desk from the pile of tools and materials that
took residency on there, I fool around with <a href='utf8.html'>UTF-8</a>
encoding support in <a href='left.html'>Left</a>. Looking into how diacritics
can be appended to other glyphs, I've begun to consider if I couldn't possibly
encode the <a href='uxntal_alphabet.html'>Uxntal Alphabet</a> entirely from
pre-existing glyphs within the two-bytes range and use diacritics for
modes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Made a few improvements to <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/left' target='_blank'>Left</a>'s support for UTF-8.</li>
		<li>Rewrote the <a href='../etc/uxnrepl/src/uxn.js' target='_blank'>uxn.js</a>, it now passes the opcode tests.</li>
		<li>Added <a href='https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Example%20programs' target='_blank'>example programs</a> to the concat wiki.</li>

	<h2>2024-02-25 Hello, Dot?</h2>
	<p>Our plans for the summer are coming into focus. It looks like we'll depart
early, head as far north as we can make it, and see if the boat and its crew
can weather the cold. This ought to give us taste of what we might expect would
we decide to make it further into the arctic next year.</p>
	<p>Someone found an interesting undefined behavior in the assembly of Uxn code,
where the <a href='uxntal_labels.html#scope'>nesting of child labels</a> could be
implemented in one of two ways, leading to an incompatiblity between
assemblers. I've explored this further and found myself pulled me into a
concatenative object-oriented programming rabbit-hole.</p>

	<h2>2024-01-26 Back to music</h2>
	<p>I've originally started looking into virtual machines to build a target to
host some games, a handful of tools and my wiki &mdash; but instead of stopping
once I had done so, I kept pushing further and became obsessed with this
programming language design stuff, and along the way, I lost track of why I was
even doing it all in the first place. After a two year detour, I look back and
I've almost totally ignored my other interests as a digital artist and
musician. It's about time I find my way back. </p>

	<h2>2024-01-13 Maintenance</h2>
	<p>The forge that we use at Hundred Rabbits has been <a
href='https://status.sr.ht' target='_blank'>taken down by DDoS attacks</a> and
is struggling to come back online, the event reminded us that we ought to also
have mirrors and release versions of these source files available elsewhere. I've begun
to host copies across our various websites. The builds are still
accessible through <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io'
target='_blank'>itch.io</a>.</p>
	<p>Until we regain access and release the changes of the last few days, keeping
with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use I've taken a
moment to write a kind of <i>pocket version</i> of the console emulator and <a
href='drifblim.html'>self-hosted assembler</a> as to see how many lines are
needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket
emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have
been <a href='uxn.html'>added to the wiki</a>.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, if anyone is looking for a specific file that is currently
unavailable, get in touch!</p>
