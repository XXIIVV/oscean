	<h2>2025-09-02 Year Of The Basic Desktop!</h2>
	<p>Once again, I find myself wasting valuable scientific computing equipment on clerical work. This time around, I've persuaded my computer to evaluate <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/115136151460275352' target='_blank'>BASIC programs</a>. I began implementing the graphical interpreter back in 2023 without ever finishing it, leaving it in a utterly unusable state. </p>
	<p>But, I resumed working on it the other day, overcome by a kind of creative fever, I finished it, released it as <a href='basic.html'>Sunflower BASIC</a> and I haven't been able to put it down since. It's just too fun. Maybe this will appeal to someone's else nihilistic programming sensibilities!</p>
	<q>What are we going to do? Return to the order of the day, presumably..</q>

	<p>Whenever we're not busy playing outside, doing errands or stuffing our faces with wild plums, I spend some of my time translating the lesser known Solresol documents, more specifically Joséphine Sudre's <i>Théorie & Pratique</i>, and incorporating the different families and categories to the <a href='../etc/solrela/index.html' target='_blank'>En-Sr Translator</a>.</p>

	<h2>2025-07-28 Workout Routine</h2>
	<p>I've received a few messages asking about workout plans, and
like I've said before, I am the last person you want to take advice from. I'm
merely writing these down for the sake of being able to look back on what I
tried. My aim in all this is to build just enough upperbody strength so that I
can do a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle-up'
target='_blank'>muscle-up</a> when spring rolls in. Unless you're
already somewhat deep into your calisthenics journey, I wouldn't try
replicating any of this.</p>
	<p>We're already a few weeks deep into summer, so I want to look back at how
working out aboard actually <i>worked out</i>. Our life aboard has been much
too chaotic to allow for any kind of pattern, so I can't say that I've
developed anything like a routine, but these are the predictably recurring
exercises that I've enjoyed doing every single day:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rowing: 10min.</li>
		<li>Dips: 1x10.</li>
		<li>Dead-Hang: 2x60sec.</li>
		<li>Pull Ups: 1x10, 2x5.</li>
		<li>Hand Grippers: 10x50lb, 10x100lb, 5x150lb.</li>

	<h2>2025-07-01 Tent</h2>
	<p>A couple of months ago, on the train to Strange Loop, I had the good
fortune of sharing a cabin with Anders, whom I had just met and who
shared with me a way of guessing at the correct settings for shooting with a
broken light meter using a technique called <i>Sunny-16</i>. Unfortunately, by
the time I had made it back home, I couldn't recall how it all worked.</p>
	<p>I just spent the past few days anchored by Blakely Island, wandering into the
woods holding old <a href='film.html'>film</a> cameras with a few friends, 
which I am now gladly counting Anders among them who spent
time with me to go through the motion once again using my own Voightlander and
its broken light meter.</p>
	<p><b>Sunny-16</b> goes something like this: At f-16, with the shutter speed at
about roughly the film speed, should turn up a good picture on a sunny clear
day. From there, one can work their way down the f-stops, so that at the speed
of the film, f-8 would be a cloudy day, f-4 an indoors picture, and so on.</p>

	<h2>2025-06-09 Working Out</h2>
	<p>Before casting off from Victoria, we wondered if it'd be enjoyable, or even
safe to work out aboard Pino. It did take a bit of getting used to at first,
but we've eventually both fallen into a daily habit of doing pull ups from the
companionway, dips with the cockpit seats, seated rows by trapping a resistance
band around a winch and lat pulldowns from the boom.</p>
	<p>One of my projects for the next few years is to raise my grip strength enough that
I can reliably close down a 70kg hand gripper, so every evening, I pull out a
book or a video(solar permitting) and do hand exercises for an hour or so.</p>

	<h2>2025-05-24 Cast Off</h2>
	<p>It's happening! I've begun drafting a rough layout for a tentative book
project, for which the working title is currently <i>Turnip Complete</i>. I
don't know if I can actually go through with this idea yet, but I'm going find
out over the summer, and hopefully have something to show in the fall. The idea
would be to have a paper artifact that contains everything that currently makes
up the Uxn/Varvara ecosystem, from implementation details, to language
specification; all from basic principles.</p>
	<p>We're just about ready to cast off from Victoria for the summer, and today was
my last day at the gym. I pushed hard these past few months, and it's beginning
to pay off. The back pains I had are gone, I sleep much better, I feel stronger
and clothes even fit me better. I gained 10kg, and I'm hoping to reach my ideal
weight of 80kg in the next few months. I have plans to work out from aboard <a
href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, but in practice, I'm not sure how possible, or safe,
it'll be..</p>

	<h2>2025-05-05 For The Future</h2>
	<p>Over the years, by haphazardly filling-in missing details to the docs as
questions arose, I've let the <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal language</a> pages
grow into a tangled and overgrown labyrinthine mess that oftener threw folks
into opaque dead-ends than answer questions.</p>

	<p>This week, a pointedly cutting criticism of the Uxn documentation shook me out of
the laissez-faire that I had over these few pages and reminded me how letting
it go the way I did was a disservice to others, but especially myself,
considering that I may be using this tool, possibly for the rest of my
life.</p>

	<p>Since I couldn't clearly discern what should and shouldn't be there, I've
asked for help, and got excellent ideas. With feedback from both new learners
and experienced folks, I rewrote most of the documentation, included new
examples, expanded tests and added setup instructions for both Uxn, and
Varvara.</p>

	<p>Looking at the documentation now, I feel like I would very much like to work
on writing a book about it, to have a paperback artifact in the style of
Henderson's <a href='https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/3299/PRG32%20vol%201.pdf'
target='_blank'>LispKit Manuals</a>. A treatise on the design and
implementation of the system from the bottom up, but plastered with
drawings.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Wrote 10 examples for the revamped <a href='../etc/uxnrepl/index.html'>Uxn REPL</a>.</li>
		<li>Made a graphical version of <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>

	<h2>2025-04-13 Paper Paper Paper</h2>
	<p>I was recently reminded of that paper about how <a

computer emulators can be operated on paper, but nothing on using the paper
itself for doing the computation. So I set out to correct that, and all the

game engine in which scenes are navigated based on which color is clicked on. I

speakers, at the cost of the usual <i>guy-packs-bytes-in-the-right-sequence</i>
talks. Which I have nothing against as someone who tend to give talks of
that exact flavor.</p>
	<p>In any case, the conference organizer apologized for the poor selection of
speakers which did not correspond to the expectations of ticket holders,
promising to resolve the issue in the following year, and in passing, that free
and open source software developers would <a href='https://assets.merveilles.town/media_attachments/files/113/886/295/005/674/393/original/9e6b93f5d01f8c12.mp4' target='_blank'>no longer</a> be welcomed as
speakers.</p>
	<p>I happened to be present in the chatroom when the apology letter went out and
merely questioned whether the choice was really about the lack of
<i>low-level</i> talks, and not something else. It did not take long for
bigots of all sorts to come out and lament the good old days of the conference
and soon the chatroom was ablaze with some pretty vile things against trans
people, this went on for hours without intervention, the usual.</p>
	<p>What I did not expect was for the conference organizer, who ghosted me for
months, to finally break radio silence to slam me for speaking out and
partially blaming me for the unraveling of the conference organization, and
decided against covering the agreed upon travel stipend. I have since
requested for the talk videos to be removed. </p>
	<q>So why is software so terrible?<br />We made it terrible.</q>

	<h2>2025-01-11 Langdev January</h2>
	<p>It has become something of a yearly ritual to take the first few days of the
year to write a new implementation of the <a href='drifblim.html'>compiler</a>
I use daily. It serves to see how my programming style and solutions to these
now familiar problems might have evolved, it also ensures that the language
itself doesn't grow beyond what I am capable of implementing in at most a
week's time.</p>
	<p>The most discernible difference in this new implementation, is that it leans
heavily on <a href='uxntal_labels.html#scope'>object-oriented patterns</a>, by
favoring methods acting on private values, over pointer arithmetic by function
application. The stack is principally used as the communication channel between
objects, for example, a text object's buffer is only ever modified through its
explicitly defined capabilities, not by a function taking a text pointer. It
turns out it limits bugs, it is faster and even often smaller!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reimplemented <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, OOP style.</li>
		<li>Added auto-complete and a <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/113811222046461898' target='_blank'>few other goodies</a> to <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</li>
		<li>Created a <a href='https://rabbits.srht.site/days/' target='_blank'>photo sharing website</a> for Hundred Rabbits.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed going back to the gym!</li>
