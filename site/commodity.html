<p>Modernity attempts to degrade our ability to pay attention. It seeks to have
us believe that we can have everything at a moment's notice, without thought
for payment, patience or production. If one does not pay for something they
will not value it. If one does not work at something they will not empathize
with it. And if one does not produce something they will not understand it.
Modernity removes each and every single one of these factors by way of credit,
addictive mechanisms and consumerism. <a

<p>The concept of liminality for thinking about <a
href='technocracy.html'>modern societies</a> is connected to the study of <a
href='simulacra.html'>theatre and performance</a>. The <i>liminal</i>
experiences of tribal cultures – in which ritual is a collective process for
navigating moments of change – are different from the <i>liminoid</i>
experiences available in modern societies, which resemble the liminal, but are
choices we opt into as individuals, like a night out at the theatre. <a

<p>When finished objects become commodities and break, they are easily replaced.
When you break a chair, you buy another chair. We know well how to make one
thousand chairs. But when a unique object breaks, we might <a
href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>mend</a>. To learn the skill of mending is to
also gain the skill of building, to understand the very urge to build. If we
never mend, we not only risk building less but building in perverse ways.</p>

<p>To mend is to comprehend a human scale problem, and without this
understanding our creations become strange creatures. The more finished goods
become commodities, the fewer opportunities an individual has to generate new
creation. The ability to mass-produce removes the opportunity for the great
many to learn to produce at all.</p>

<q>This curious world we inhabit is more wonderful than convenient, more
beautiful than it is useful, it is more to be admired and enjoyed than
used.</q>

<p>In the 1976 film Network, a newsreader about to lose his job threatens to
kill himself on live TV. Ratings skyrocket, he gets his own talk show as a
pundit, and his catchphrase “I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this
anymore!” goes viral.</p>

<q><b>Premium mediocre</b> is food that Instagrams better than it tastes.
Mediocre with just an irrelevant touch of premium, not enough to ruin the
delicious essential mediocrity.</q>

<h3>One Human Minute</h3>

<p>The Guinness Book was a best seller because it presented nothing but exceptional things, with a guarantee of authenticity. This panopticon of records had, however, a serious drawback: it was soon obsolete. No sooner had some fellow eaten forty pounds of peaches complete with pits than another not only ate more, but died immediately after from a volvulus, which gave the new record a dismal piquancy.</p>

<p>While it is untrue that there is no such thing as mental illness, that it was invented by psychiatrists to torment their patients and squeeze money out of them, it is true that normal people do far madder things than the insane. The difference is that the madman does what he does disinterestedly, whereas the normal person does it for fame, because fame can be converted into cash. Of course, some are satisfied with fame alone, so the matter is unclear. In any case, the still-surviving subspecies of intellectuals scorned this whole collection of records, and in polite society it was no distinction to remember how many miles someone on all fours could push a nutmeg with his nose painted lavender.</p>

<p>Cultural works, unlike software, are a consumer good, not a tool for use in production, or a producer's good. Producer's goods are the assets used in production, such as the tools and equipment required to produce consumer goods sold for profit. Capital demand is distinct from consumer demand. Capital demand is the demand for producer's goods; consumer demand is the demand for consumer goods. </p>

<img src='../media/refs/smoking.png' alt='Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the "body of fact" that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy. Within the business we recognize that a controversy exists. However, with the general public the consensus is that cigarettes are in some way harmful to the health. If we are successful in establishing a controversy at the public level, then there is an opportunity to put across the real facts about smoking and health.'/>

<p>Capitalism doesn't require that a profit be made on the production of capital goods because profits are made through the control of the circulation of consumer goods. Anything that decreases the cost of capital consequently increases the potential profit that can be captured through the sale of the goods. </p>

<p>Failure to understand the difference between capital demand and consumer demand propagates the myth that the success of free software can be a template for free culture. Under capitalism, only capital can be free. That's why software can be free, but culture cannot be free without more fundamental shifts in society.</p>
