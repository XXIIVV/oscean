Material progress appears to him as an increasing weight, which increasingly plunges man in the mud and in suffering.</p><q>A man is wealthy in proportion to the things he can do without.</q><h5>—Epicurus</h5><p><i>incoming(1)</i>: <a href='mirrors.html'>mirrors</a> </p><p><i>Last update on <a href='tracker.html'>18V12</a>, edited 3 times. +5/9fh</i><code style='float:right; font-size:80%'>----+-</code></p></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
