I was a notoriously distracted student in high school, I tried attending a few art classes in college before realizing that it was not the right environment to learn the things I was interested into. </p><p>I was first interested in illustration and motion graphics. I soon started writing music to complement the pictures and animations, and finally I began implementing interaction and turn these multimedia pieces into games, websites and tools.</p><h4>Where do you work?</h4><p>I work at a small research studio aboard a sailboat, called <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>hundred_rabbits</a>, where we do experiments in resilience and self-reliance using <a href='https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html' class='external' target='_blank'>low-tech solutions</a>.</p><h4>What do you do during the daytime?</h4><p>The ways in which I spend my time varies wildly from day to day, but mostly experimental research, my interests include alternative ways to store power and minimum viable solutions for <a href='longtermism.html'>technological tooling</a>.</p><h4>What is your routine?</h4><p>I go to bed choosing one thing to accomplish the next day, I wake up to tackle this <a href='routine.html'>singular task</a>. I tend to work only in the morning, get everything done before lunch. The afternoons, I spend mostly reading and learning things to help me solve the next day's task. I usually wake up with the sun, and sleep soon after sunset.</p><h4>Where do you go to get inspired?</h4><p>I share a <a href='merveilles.html'>small forum</a> with a few online friends and whenever I am looking for a new favourite thing, or some help — I know I can find it there. Everyone should build a small network, a place where they can feel comfortable to experiment, show works-in-progress and exchange on the topics of art and science in a safe place among like-minded people.</p><h4>Why do you think people should travel more?</h4><p>I found <a href='travel.html'>travel</a> to be a good catalyst toward learning <a href='language.html'>new languages</a>, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity and creativity.</p><h4>How do you draw the line between what is published, and what stays private?</h4><p>Working <a href='identity.html'>behind an avatar</a> and living online through a proxy name offers a good healthy distance between the work and the self. The Devine Lu Linvega project focuses on making explicit the reflections, and techniques for the creative process. My intimate life, my health, my friends and family are outside of the scope of this project.</p></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' alt='by-nc-sa' width='30'/></a> <a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' alt='webring' width='30'/></a> <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' alt='Merveilles' width='30'/></a> <a href='https://github.com/neauoire' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a> <span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html' target='_self'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a href='about.html' target='_self'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
