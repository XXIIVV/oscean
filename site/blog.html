<p>I only rarely find myself blogging, but when I do, I collect these entries
here. You can find questions & answers in the <a href='faqs.html'>faqs</a>, and
read a more consise and general journal that I update bi-monthly <a
href='now.html'>here</a>.</p>

<q>Where is the Life we have lost in living?<br/>
Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?<br/>
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?
</q>
<cite>The Rock by T. S. Eliot in 1934.</cite>

<h2>Notes on focus and purpose.</h2>

<p>Years of <a href='horaire.html'>personal statistics</a>, recorded by way of
<a href='routine.html'>daily journaling</a>, revealed that my time spent
traveling inspired me more than any other of sort of stimuli that was being
recorded at the time. From this insight, I have oriented my entire life toward
becoming a <a href='nomad.html'>nomad</a>.</p>

<p>Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity.
Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods
of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place for
an extended period showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school to learn to
play music, moving abroad and incessantly meeting new and different people
improved personal realization.</p>

<p>Learning to solve problems directly produced more sustained periods of output
in comparison to searching for <a href='stack.html'>solutions</a>. Investing in
building hand-crafted <a href='utilities.html'>tools</a> is somewhat equivalent to
learning general-purpose tools, but with a clear advantage of being able to
replicate the tool which is worth its weight in selfstandingness would the tool
suddenly become unavailable.</p>

<p>Optimizing toward the <b>need for less revenue</b> has yielded much better
results than optimizing toward the generation of more. Remaining immobile in
moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, than
acting impulsively and accidentally taking steps away from one's goals.</p>

<h2>Notes on home and travel.</h2>

<p>My first encounter with a nomad was during my stay in <a
href='czech.html'>Prague</a>. Already, <i>Home</i> was becoming an increasingly
vague concept at that moment in my life, but meeting someone who's home was
everywhere and nowhere had a profound effect on my young self.</p>

<p>The monthly rent of our beach-side appartment in Tokyo was of about 1.75K$,
and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing.
The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be
paid at the rate of 600$ per month. Or that by halving the costs of our current
living situation, we could become both "homeowners" while keeping our traveling
options open.</p>

<p>To think that, at the time, the harder things to let go of were instruments,
old consoles, books and some camera equipment. When the truly hard things to
let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet
connection. </p>

<p>Surely, I would not do all this for the sake of travel alone, I must have had
passions, habits and goals before I left everything to live on a sailboat. I
appears from that moment that everything that used to define me was beginning
to feel increasingly like distractions, <a
href='simulacra.html'>simulations</a> to protect me from truly experiencing
anything. I had never let myself feel cold, I had never felt hunger.</p>

<p>The wind rocks the ship sideways, keeping me up at night, but all I can feel
is that humbling sense of being present and part of that moment. I have long
forgotten about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, I
began to wonder why people even feel the need to take showers every day, and
time away from social networks really does make me feel better. I traded the
things I thought I cared about, for things I didn't know existed.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/miss_spider.jpg' style='float:right;margin-left:30px'/>

<p>Eventually, I got back to building things, I learned how to fix sails, repair
a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live
without power.</p>

<p>We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with
dolphins, we have climbed mountains on deserted islands, and we have met the
most amazing people. When it is our time to go, we will have no regrets, for we
were fortunate to have seen more than we could ever hope for.</p>


<h2>Notes on sociality and distance.</h2>

<p>If you asked us why we decided to cross the ocean, I don't think we could give you a straight answer. Even the authors of our sailing manuals, considering the many perils of the sea, cannot explain what might compel anyone to travel by sail when more modern, convenient and safer means exist.</p>
<p>Why would anyone do something with a very real risk of not making it back to shore, and furthermore, for <a href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>no obvious reward</a>. Perhaps we do these things in the name of freedom, freedom to practice direct experience with all that it entails.</p>
<p>Smart devices to take away the pain of thinking deep thoughts, social things against the solitude, forever removing ourselves, in exchange for protectedness, for a complete thoughtless <a href='shining_wire.html'>socialized inexistence</a>.</p>
<p>A creeping numbness might be to blame for our own search of this <a href='tenth_hand.html'>direct experience</a>, in the form of long distance sailing, to let ourselves feel cold so we could sense the subtler changes in the weather, to go hungry to appreciate simpler foods.</p>
<p>Similarly, one might begin to talk instead of watching <a href='simulacra.html'>talk-shows</a> and to play instead of watching game shows — To value the entire spectrum of sensations as necessary members of the whole that is the deliberate existence, with its potential for failure, awkwardness, loneliness, harm and death included.</p>
<p>Convenient products will protect those living at odds with nature. Novel and fashionable horrors will be popularized to subvert anyone into docility, else new fears will be provided as obedience demands.</p><p>In the name of security, a modern citizen will be thoroughly handled. A modern civilisation will deem itself total as it finally does away with all inconveniences, vanquished the totality of the Unknowable, the Indifferent, the Unorganizeable, of Nature, by means of paving over it.</p>
<p>We have seen the non-participation to the throughput mechanisms of society labeled as escapism, but we look at it in reverse where one escapes by being apart from nature. An illusory sense of dominion and domestication of nature might make one think of it as a place where one can escape to, and this is re-enforced when seen through the lense of a synthetic protective layer of proxies and simulations, but the protective layer doesn't curve outward upon nature, but inward upon the individual. And that is <i>absolute</i> escapism.</p>
<p>We believe that one can use nature's indifference as a reminder of the actual fortitude of their being, to learn of one's own true capacity for resilience when communing with nature — Ideas altogether at odds with modern stories, or an invitation to be part of something.</p>

<h2>Notes on sustainability and resilience.</h2>

<p>In an age of disposable smart devices and unrepairable electronics, there are
few topics that occupy my mind as much as <a href='obsolescence.html'>planned
obsolescence</a>.</p>

<p>Living aboard a <a href='pino.html'>sailboat</a>, away from reliable internet
connectivity, and outside of delivery networks, forces us to explore ways with
which we can strengthen and simplify the toolset onto which we rely to stay
afloat.</p>

<p>Casting off, we forlet 3-in-1 packages, bloated always-online services, and
establish practices of recyclism, minimum viable products, small-sharp modular
utilities. We see smart and robust as opposing attributes to a device, smart is
inherently contrary to a single purpose tool, and thus incompatible with
dependable solutions.</p>

<p>I periodically find myself thinking about operating systems, or more
specifically the interaction design of OSes. In attempting to tackle the
difficult UX challenges of that space, unrealizing that my failure to solve
these issues might very well come from the simple fact that the purpose of
operating systems is to enable multi-tasking, multi-tasking that I try to
eradicate from my daily life, making these issues deeply unsolvable and my love
for sharp tools and OSes irreconcilable.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/jugend_may_1899.png'/>

<p>Sometimes, I wonder if we shouldn't re-orient our focus onto building things
to be run on small low-power open-source single-purpose boards, but I also
consider the impact of pushing for the production of more electronics, perhaps
creating software targeting old hardware might be what we should be looking
into. There must be a reason why everybody favours creating new disposable
electronics over supporting pre-existing hardware?</p>

<p>Despite all this, I wonder, Is there a way to create and distribute software
and electronics in a way that is environmentally conscious? perhaps <a
href='stack.html'>not</a>.</p>
<h2>Notes on Routine and Habits.</h2>

<p>A <b>typical day</b> usually begins at around 6:00am. I rise and work-out with
a mix of weights and callisthenics for an hour on an empty stomach. I have
breakfast, a protein shake, 5g-10g creatine, and a coffee. I usually ever
<b>only drink one cup</b> per day.</p>

<p>I immediately set off to complete the tasks I have waiting in my <a
href='hpda.html'>notes</a>. I have about 3 hours of undisturbed flow before the
distraction surrounding lunch-time pulls me away from the work. My goal for
each day, is to complete at least <b>a single task</b> that should take about 3
hours to complete — Or between 4 to 5 pomodoros.</p>

<p>After the last pomodoro, I usually <b>cook for a half-hour</b>, and then
<b>eat for a half-hour</b>, and then <b>walk for an hour</b>, to fully leave
the haze of the <i>flowstate</i>. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance
aboard, superficial work and experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent
reading and learning. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake
up to the next day and to experiment with.</p>

<p>The superficial work that I do involves answering emails, replying to forums,
editing wikipedia entries, doing maintenance to various repositories, and so
on..</p>

<p>The day ends with <b>journaling for a half-hour</b> at which point I record
the tasks done, and the <a href='mirrors.html'>lessons learned</a>. Before
sleeping, I usually <b>read for a half-hour</b>, I go to bed with a <a
href='reading.html'>book</a>, and a highlighter pen. I overline the things I
want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.</p>

<p>I have kept journals recording the oscillation of <b>Efficiency</b> and
<b>Effectiveness</b>, and used this data to optimize and navigate my own
personal tempers. Based on previously recorded patterns, I assign to myself
each day a single task to complete. The task is chosen specifically to utilize
the optimal amount of available stamina.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/process.png' width='300'/>

<p>When a workday ends before the daily tasks are completed, the day was a
planning failure; and the tasks are broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned
to one day. When a task is completed too early, the day is also a planning
failure.</p>

<p>I try to not go to sleep until I have recorded the events of day in some form,
and ideas for the next one. The ideas are selected in the following order: I
first address the problems that slow me down, the things I find lacking in my
life and the answers to questions that occupies my mind and keep me up at
night.</p>

<q>You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you
vote, but what you spend your time on.</q>

<h2>Saturday, February 15, 2025</h2>

<p>I've had the immense fortune of living many lives, I spent my twenties playing
musician and artist, my thirties, programmer and long-distance sailor. For as
far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a generalist, and I've
never regretted it. Somewhere between natural inclinations, inspiration,
influences, and some more direct forces, I've tried to feel at the changes in
the wind and find my place in the world accordingly.</p>

<p>My late twenties happened when rent prices were rising at a faster pace than I
could keep up with doing what I enjoyed, coinciding with a market saturated
with affordable second-hand vessels from the aging boomer generation. So, two
vagabonds with relatively few means and a bit of technology, could find a
sailboat and travel the world, not long ago this would have been unthinkable
without considerable sponsorship. This makes me wonder just for how much longer
this door will remain open until distances grow further apart once again.</p>

<p>We read of the golden age of blue water cruising and find their voyages to be
as irreproduceable as our own are to others, just nine years ago, mainly due to
bureaucracy, depopulation, aging infrastructure and destructive weather
events. Countries are growing more insular, the weather more erratic and
dangerous, the cost of living siphoning people's capacity to escape its
whirlpool.</p>

<q>The meaning of <i>fitness</i> is the capacity of an
organism to survive.</q>

<p>At what feels like the tumultuous tail end of the anacyclotic cycle,
considering this global trajectory, and our choosing this way of life, does not
speak highly of our ability to plan against a changing environment and position
ourselves favorably to it. </p>

<p>A decade of arts has given me a fervor to live and wanting to learn, a decade
on the water has afforded me space to acquire some green skills. I spent near
40 years inside my head cultivating a place I liked, in circles where the body
has always ever been the domain of vanity alone, thinking myself to be a
generalist where in truth, only ever affecting a generalism of a highly specific
sort.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/tekitou.png' style='height:300px'/>

<p>It's a cruel twist that cognitive function decline is most acute on those
around me who have exercised in all the ways of mind, but none of the body.</p>

<q>The philosopher's body also must be well prepared for work because often virtues 
use it as a necessary tool for the activities of life.</q>
