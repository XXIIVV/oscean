<main><h2>The lotus fruit is about the size of the lentisk berry and in sweetness
resembles the date.</h2>

<article>
	<p>Thence for nine days' space I was borne by direful winds over the teeming
deep; but on the tenth we set foot on the land of the Lotus-eaters, who eat a
flowery food.</p>
	<p>There we went on shore and drew water, and straightway my comrades took their
meal by the swift ships. But when we had tasted food and drink, I sent forth
some of my comrades to go and learn who the men were, who here ate bread upon
the earth; two men I chose, sending with them a third as a herald.</p>
	<p>So they went straightway and mingled with the Lotus-eaters, and the
Lotus-eaters did not plan death for my comrades, but gave them of the lotus to
taste. And whosoever of them ate of the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, had no
longer any wish to bring back word or to return, but there they were fain to
abide among the Lotus-eaters, feeding on the lotus, and forgetful of their
homeward way. These men, therefore, I brought back perforce to the ships,
weeping, and dragged them beneath the benches and bound them fast in the hollow
ships; and I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to embark with speed on the
swift ships, lest perchance anyone should eat of the lotus and forget his
homeward way. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches,
and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars.</p>
	<p>Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the
Cyclopes, an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods,
plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for
them without sowing or ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the
rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase. Neither
assemblies for council have they, nor appointed laws, but they dwell on the
peaks of lofty mountains in hollow caves, and each one is lawgiver to his
children and his wives, and they reck nothing one of another.</p>
