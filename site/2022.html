<main><h2>2022</h2>

<p>We sailed to Desolation Sound in late spring spring, spent the summer up
there, and didn't return until the fall. We left with stores bursting with <a
href='http://grimgrains.com/site/lactofermentation.html'
target='_blank'>preserved foods</a>, allowing us to stay away for months
without the need to resupply.</p>

<p>The year was beginning and I hadn't entirely made up my mind about <a
href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>, I had doubts that it might be the thing that I would
want to keep on using, as it often goes with such projects, but the year came
and went without ever finding myself wanting to program in any other
language.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/785.jpg'/>

<p>For the year of 2022, Richard Adams' Watership Down, was my favourite <a
href='reading.html'>book</a>. Only Yesterday was my favourite <a
href='watching.html'>movie</a>. SadSvit's Cassette was my favourite <a

	<h2>2022-12-25 Reversible Computing</h2>
	<p>This week, I was introduced to <a href='reversible_computing.html'>reversible
computing</a> and linear logic, which not only do not generate garbage, but
also preserves state by making any loss of entropy explicit and an integral
part of the program's architecture. To say that this new knowledge shook my
understanding of programming would be an understatement.</p>
	<p>I don't know what 2023 has in store, but some of it will be invariably spent
tangled up in this.</p>

	<h2>2022-12-12 Beetbug</h2>
	<p>Continuing my recent experiments with the <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/blinkengenie' target='_blank'>self-hosted
emulator</a>, I decided to repurpose it and turn it into an entirely
virtualized step-debugger. It is called <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>,
after <a href='https://github.com/randrew/uxn32' target='_blank'>Uxn32</a>'s
debugger. To improve error reporting across the ecosystem, I've also written a
<a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> specification that will allow the
various emulators and debuggers to add labels to addresses when throwing errors
and warnings.</p>
	<p>As I was learning to use the Soroban to do elementary level multiplications, I
stumbled on this <a href='https://ethw.org/Ancient_Computers'
target='_blank'>fantastic article</a> on the use of the Salamis Tablet, which
has been fascinating me and occupying my mind at night. There, now it can
torment you too.</p>

	<h2>2022-11-27 Soroban</h2>
	<p>I had this idea of implementing the Uxn virtual machine <i>in itself</i>, to
virtualize the memory and runtime entirely in a <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/blinkengenie' target='_blank'>sandboxed
emulator</a> rom. That would allow something like a debugger to be built that
doesn't preclude any special <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> support.</p>
	<p>I also tried writing a <a href='http://turboforth.net/tutorials/blocks.html'
target='_blank'>block editor</a> for Uxntal, but failed, I couldn't make up my
mind on how to visualize each cell, and in the end, I've decided to drop the
idea and went back to reading Takashi Kojima's <i>Advanced Abacus</i> book and
toying with my virtual soroban while the snow fell on the boat.</p>

hours exchanging ideas with <a href='https://www.inkandswitch.com'
