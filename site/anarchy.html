Anarchists wish to create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation.</p><p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price — except at the price of liberty.</p><q>Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.</q><h5>—Clay Shirky</h5><p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.</p><q>The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.</q><h5>Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed</h5><h3>green anarchism</h3><ul><li><b>Health</b>: A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</li><li><b>Dark Greens</b>: The ones who believe that environmental problems are an inherent part of industrialized civilization, and seek radical political change.</li><li><b>Light Greens</b>: The ones who see protecting the environment first and foremost as a personal responsibility, focusing on environmentalism as a lifestyle choice.</li><li><b>Veganism</b>: A philosophy and way of living which seeks to prevent all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, other animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.</li><li><b>Ecofeminism</b>: Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of gender to theorize on the relationship between humans and the natural world.</li></ul></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
