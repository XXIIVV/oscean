<h2>Capitalism Fascism Reactionism Fuck Off!</h2>

<img src='../media/refs/nonazi.png' style='float:left; margin-right:30px; margin-bottom: 15px;'/>

<p>Because of the decentralized nature of some of my work, this has to be
spelled out quite clearly: Preparing for impending apocalyptic events should
mean <b>collective action and structural reform</b>, not individualism and
isolation.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/nocars.png' style='float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom: 15px;'/>

<p>I am committed to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and
racial supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and
its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and
ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary.
To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking. <a
href='https://blood-and-dust.com/politics/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>I am aggressively opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism,
ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power
structures of all kinds.</p>

<article>
	<p>The <b>Three Arrows</b> used by anti-fascist anarchists originated from the
Social Democratic Party of Germany to mean "neither Stalin's slaves nor
Hitler's henchmen" and was designed to be stenciled over swastikas. It
represents the different types of authoritarianism that should be opposed:
Reactionaries, Fascists & Authoritarian Socialists. </p>

<p>The <b>myth of progress</b> tells us that we are destined for greatness, that
we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called
<i>nature</i>, which we have now triumphantly subdued.</p>

<img src="../media/refs/marsh_arabs2.jpg" alt="Marsh Arabs houses on the water"/>

<p>It came to be understood among the people of our culture that life in <i>the
wild</i> was governed by a single, cruel law known as "kill or be killed." In
recent decades, ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In
fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the
wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the
community as a whole. This system of laws has been called, among other things,
the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and <i>animal
ethics</i>.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/fahrenheit451.jpg'/>

<p>Collapse won't be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning
off the air-conditioning. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one:
understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront
this problem, and the sooner we realize there's nothing we can do to save
ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal
humility, to our <a href='collapse.html'>new reality</a>.</p>

<p>An Adaptationist is someone who understands and respects the science, and
recognises, based on history, that humanity has not cooperated on what what
needed to be done to address climate change. Adaptationists, in realising this,
make active changes in their own lives & within their own local community
because that is all they have left.</p>

<h2>A way of living which seeks to prevent exploitation of, and cruelty to,
other animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.</h2>

<p>Specisism is discrimination on the basis of species, oppression and judgment
of an animal on the basis of that animal's species or that animal's
non-membership in a species. The belief in <a href='ethics.html'>human
superiority</a> over other animals or certain non-human animals' superiority
over others.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/alf.jpg'/>

<p>Animal Rights is the position that non-human animals have rights and inherent
value independent of their use.</p>

<h3>Animal Rights</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Animal Liberation Front</b>: An international, leaderless resistance that engages in removing animals from laboratories and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses and veterinary care, and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live.</li>
	<li><b>Animal Advocacy</b>: Promotion of the interests of animals, generally. Includes work for animal rights and animal welfare.</li>
	<li><b>Commodification</b>: The conversion of a living being, principle, or natural environment into an "object" that is used, exchanged, or consumed for profit or other desired gain.</li>
	<li><b>Debarking</b>: The surgical removal and manipulation of tissue in a dog's vocal cords to drastically quiet his or her natural bark. Debarking does not address the underlying reasons that a dog may be barking excessively, and the dog will continue to bark, albeit more quietly or silently.</li>
	<li><b>Draize Test</b>: Eye-irritation test for household products and cosmetics in which drops of a substance are placed in the eyes of rabbits, causing the animals ulcers, blindness, and other injuries before they are ultimately killed.</li>
	<li><b>Flowerpot Technique</b>: A technique used in sleep deprivation studies designed to allow NREM sleep but prevent REM sleep.</li>
	<li><b>Forced Molting</b>: The egg-industry practice of artificially inducing hens to molt by depriving them of food for several days to two weeks when their egg production has declined.</li>
	<li><b>Rape Rack</b>: The industry term referring to the contraptions in which cows and pigs are restrained while they are forcibly inseminated.</li>
	<li><b>Veal Crate</b>: Small crate in which a calf being raised for veal is confined and tied up. The calf's movement within the crate is intentionally restricted to limit the strengthening of muscle, and an insufficient diet is provided intentionally to keep the cow anemic.</li>

    <td>Isn't it preferable for farm animals to live their lives in the bucolic serenity of verdant fields of clover, galloping insouciantly hither and yon, rather than living in the deplorable squalor and filth of factory farms? Isn't that more humane? More compassionate? More responsible?</td>
    <td>While some methods of breeding, enslaving, and slaughtering animas are admittedly less cruel than others, they all involve unpardonable acts of violence against an innocent and defenseless animal who had, in most cases, lived only a fraction of her natural life.</td>

    <td>Our ancestors ate animals.</td>
    <td>Non-human animals have a long history of being a part of the human diet, but this fact says nothing at all about the moral or ethical propriety of breeding, enslaving, killing, and eating animals. Humans also have a long history of killing, raping, and butchering one another and until somewhat recently.

Unless you're either a.) sitting on a sand dune in the middle of the Sahara Desert, or b.) sitting in an igloo somewhere in the North Pole.

    <td>Since those living in and near the Arctic Circle are less than 1/100th of a percent of the population, their meat consumption is mostly irrelevant to the larger point about the impact of exploiting animals on a global scale. These are probably good reasons why no one should live in the extreme north anyway—this is simply not a natural habitat for humans, so we aren't justified for trying to exploit it as much as possible for our benefit.</td>

    <td>Merely because someone has survived to an old age while maintaining unhealthy habits does not testify to the merit of those habits. Considered within those contexts, the evidence very clearly suggests that a whole foods, plant-based diet is quite conducive to optimal human health and that eating animals and the products derived from them is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and many other bodily ailments. </td>

By this outward show of asceticism, he could claim that he was dedicated to the service of his people.

    <td>It is the intention of most vegans to cause as little harm and as little suffering as possible to all sentient beings, including field mice. That some measure of harm will result from some of our choices is practically unavoidable. What the vegan concern themselves with, however, is minimizing that harm as much as they can by making choices that don't require that animals be enslaved, exploited, and slaughtered.</td>

    <td>What this argument also fails to acknowledge is the difference between killing as matter of pure necessity and killing as matter of convenience or pleasure, which are by no means morally equivalent. Killing as matter of survival(as only a small handful of subsistence hunters do) is a vastly different thing from killing for the sake of sensory pleasure or out of convenience. Let's say that you, eater of meat, eggs, and dairy, were given a choice between two life-style alternatives. On the one hand, you could get all the nutrients and calories you need from a healthy, cruelty-free, vegan diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, and grains, all of which are readily available at almost any supermarket. On the other hand, you could subsist on a diet that necessitates cruelty, exploitation, and slaughter and which contributes significantly to climate change, deforestation, water scarcity, water pollution, ocean “dead zones”, habitat loss, species extinction, and world hunger.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><th colspan='2'>Might is Right</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It is a near certainty that at some point in any discussion of the vegan life-style with a meat-eater, the word "Bacon!" will be invoked, as if the momentary sensory experience of eating bacon somehow constitutes a legitimate moral defense of or justification for the torment and slaughter of the pigs from whose bodies bacon is produced.</td>
    <td>An important part of being a responsible and well-rounded person is recognizing that just because you enjoy something doesn’t make it right. The assumption that a moment's sensory pleasure on the part of a human being somehow provides legitimate moral grounds for tormenting and slaughtering an innocent and defenseless non-human animal is best challenged by substituting the sense of taste with either the auditory or olfactory sense. The ability to recognize that some (indeed, most) things are more important than sensory pleasure, which is, in any case, always subject to diminishing returns, is indispensable for anyone who aspires to live a life that is not merely hedonistic.</td>

<h2>Anarchy means not necessarily the absence of order but an absence of rule.</h2>

<p>Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems
of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism,
ableism, <a href='vegan.html'>speciesism</a>, and religion. </p>

<p>It is founded on the observation that since only a few are wise enough to
rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others. Anarchists wish to
create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/anarchybook.png' style='float:right; width:120px; margin-left:30px'/>

<p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without
borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for
the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment. </p>

<p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long
as each allows all to do the same. A just society is one in which liberty for
one person is constrained only by the demands created by equal liberty for
another.</p>

<p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by
obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the
various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the
satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a person.</p>

<q>The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.</q>
<cite>Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed</cite>

<p>Anarchism directs its forces against the greatest foe of all social equality;
namely, the State, organized authority, or statutory law. Just as religion has
fettered the human mind, and as property, or the monopoly of things, has
subdued and stifled people's needs, so has the State enslaved the spirit,
dictating every phase of conduct. It matters not whether it is government by
divine right or majority rule. In every instance its aim is the absolute
subordination of the individual.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/borders.png' width='300'/>

<p>The State is the economic master of its servants who
would either remain true to their political faith and lose their economic
support, or they would cling to their economic master and be utterly unable to
do the slightest good. In all states there is the same principle of justice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of the stronger.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Anarchy</b>: A word that comes from the Greek, and signifying "without government", the state of a people without any constituted authority.</li>
	<li><b>Health</b>: A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</li>
	<li><b>Ecofeminism</b>: Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of gender to theorize on the relationship between humans and the natural world.</li>
	<li><b>Dark Greens</b>: The ones who believe that environmental problems are an inherent part of industrialized civilization, and seek radical political change.</li>
	<li><b>Light Greens</b>: The ones who see protecting the environment first and foremost as a personal responsibility, focusing on environmentalism as a lifestyle choice.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Elections serve to represent us to each other at our worst, distilling the most offensive, cowardly, and servile aspects of the species. Many people who would never personally wrest a mother from her children are capable of endorsing deportation from the privacy of a voting booth, just as most people who eat meat could never work at a slaughterhouse.<a href='https://crimethinc.com/2016/11/09/president-trump-countdown-to-apocalypse' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>The contention that a standing army and navy is the best security of peace is
about as logical as the claim that the most peaceful citizen is he who goes
about heavily armed.</p>

<h2>Sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy.</h2>

<p>Solarpunk is a movement centered on using and being affected by the use of

social justice and civic empowerment. A recognition that economic, social, and
ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.</p>

<p>Permaculture is the science and practice of creating semi-permanent
ecosystems of nature. The resilience of any such ecosystem is equal to it's
diversity + interconnectedness. Permaculture design is a system of assembling
conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to
benefit life in all its forms. It seeks to provide a sustainable and secure
place for living things on this earth.</p>

<p>Punk is a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It
manifests through <a href='sabotage.html'>direct action</a>, such as protest or
demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades,
squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and
business property destruction.</p>

<p>Solarpunk is also a reaction to the cynical and dystopian imaginaries that
have come out of the fear of climate change. It is a way of tackling
ecoanxieties and an invitation to complement the important work of climate
scientists. Just as climate scientists have sought to warn the world about the
dangers of climate change, Solarpunks are offering alternative visions to the
helplessness often generated by such warnings.</p>

<p id='disassembly'><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of
a product can be disassembled for repair and for <i>end
of life</i>. This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a
product's life cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken
apart at the end of its life so that each component can be reclaimed. </p>

<q>That which cannot be repaired is already broken.</q>

<p>This means using simple mechanical fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling
components with their material type, and ensuring components can be
disassembled with everyday tools. Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a
<i>sustainable</i> product, designing a product for disassembly is a more
concrete, quantifiable approach to ecologically sound making and to
consumption. </p>

<h3>Articulating the Value of Absence</h3>

<p>There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs,
advised by the concepts of permacomputing, and personalized systems to address
those needs, but there are no permacomputing products. Permacomputing is
concerned about finding these limits, and <b>not their artifacts</b>.</p>

<p>Computation is intrinsically <b>self-obviating</b>, which is to mean that the
computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less necessary
to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to provide for
their own welfare.</p>
