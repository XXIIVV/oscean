<h2>2023</h2>

<p>It's funny how I can go from being utterly terrified at the onset of a
project such as the <a href='https://100r.co/site/electrical_refit.html'
target='_blank'>total rewiring</a> of <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, to looking
back thinking that it wasn't at all as hard as you expected, and having that
familiar realization that that twinge of fear is more often about
<i>starting</i> than it is about doing the task itself. </p>

<p>As a little gift to ourselves, Rek and I ported <a
href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> to <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>, which
somewhat ensures that this little world to remains playable now that the
previous builds have begun to have mixed success running on recent operating
systems.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/816.jpg'/>

<p>Rek and I were invited to do a residency at LEÃ‘A, and we sailed to our dream
destination, the breath-taking <a
href="https://100r.co/site/princess_louisa_inlet.html" target="_blank">Princess
Louisa Inlet</a>. I had, once again, the opportunity of crossing the US by
train, eastward this time, with a bunch of amazing people heading to the last
of the <a href='https://100r.co/site/computing_and_sustainability.html'
target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conferences. I got a tattoo of my favourite
demon, Stolas, by my friend and favourite tattoo artist <a
href='https://ritualdust.com/tattoo/' target='_blank'>Lizbeth</a>. </p>

<p>After a short fling with <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel
computing</a>, I realized that it was more trouble than it was worth for the
scale of projects that interested me. I've added lambdas to Uxntal, which was
certainly the single greatest UX improvement to the language since its
creation.</p>

<p>This crazy and wonder-full year ended with the publication of Rek's latest
novel <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>, and as the year and projects come
to an end, we are now turning our gaze back to the horizon for the next year,
and our next projects.</p>

<p>For the year of 2023, Maurice Renard's Le Peril Bleu, was my favourite <a
href='reading.html'>book</a>. Coline Serreau's La Belle Verte was my favourite <a
href='watching.html'>movie</a>. Cimerion's Contresort was my favourite <a
href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

	<h2>2023-12-28 Lisp</h2>
	<p>I've been taking it easy for the last few days of the year, cooked a lot,
walked a lot. I've been re-reading SICP and idly poking at implementing a <a

exploring low-level symbolic computing, but who knows where these things might
lead.</p>

felt great to revisit this old problem that stumped me before, and solve
it.</p>
	<p>Members of the <a href='solresol.html'>Solresol</a> community and I talked
about the lack of useful example sentences in the language, and how the handful

	<h2>2023-09-25 Strange Loop Or Die Tryin'</h2>
	<p>On the eve of the talk, I sit half-awake waiting for my first real meal since
leaving Victoria to arrive, it's been two hours, blatter is coming down hard on
this very loud, and very understaffed, and only available vegetarian place
within walking farness from the hotel. And, my voice is shut, the talk is in a
few hours.</p>

<p>I normally am a really careful planner when it comes to giving these sorts of
technical talks, you wouldn't catch me going out the night before.</p>

<p>I had assumed that the train from Seattle would either carry their one
vegetarian meal on the menu, or accommodate. After a first day of eating cold
bread loaves with margarine, and an altercation with an uncompromising
attendant on the second day, I managed to secure myself a "<i>Steamed Russet
Potato A-la Tomato Sauce</i>" for the third.</p>

<p>I had also assumed that the venue would carry palatable vegan options, or that
I could cook my own. After missing the Strange Loop meal service twice in a
row, due to talk scheduling conflicts, I managed to queue long enough to
acquire one of the last remaining scoops of an awful vegan soup. I promptly
returned to stealing whole fruits from the hotel gym and eating them in my
room, which I was content with. The problem that wasn't apparent at first was
that eating sweets all day kept me up all night. </p>

<p>Despite these mistakes in preparing properly for the road leading to the talk,
I managed to show up on stage on time, give an (hopefully) entertaining
presentation at Strange Loop 2023. I'd love to give a sunderly thank to Jack
Rusher for the tea that brought my voice back, and Josh Morrow for letting me
borrow their laptop and install Uxn on it for the presentation.</p>

	<h2>2023-09-09 Solresol</h2>
	<p>Now that the first pass of proof-reading for <a

cleaning up some of the worlding aspects of the book, which include <a

Lupin's dialects can be whistled, and as to encode the various poems of the
story into pitches, we decided to pick the <a href='solresol.html'>Solresol</a>
constructed language as a suitable candidate.</p>
	<p>Not previously knowing the language, I have spent the past few days neck-deep
in digital archeology excavating some of the language's vanishing documents
from the Wayback Machine and transcribing them in a format that will allow me
to translate the texts. While I'm at it, I'm planning on translating the <a

	<p>While implementing changes to <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a>, I noticed
how many single-purpose labels were used merely to hop over short lengths of
code, enough that having ran of ideas for names to called them, I would default
to things such as <code>&skip</code>, <code>&continue</code> or even
<code>&ok</code>. The solution was to create anonymous labels, and as to be
capable of nesting them, I ended up inadvertently adding <a

code readability, and as a side effect allowed for the rapid creation of tree

system like <a href='smalltalk.html'>Smalltalk</a>'s definition of interfaces

	<h2>2023-05-12 Type Inference</h2>
	<p>For a few weeks now, I've been sketching the basis for a <a
href='uxntal_types.html'>type inference</a> system for Uxntal. I first came
across a stack-effect validator when writing <a
href='https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-inference.html'
target='_blank'>Factor</a>, and I've been meaning to make my own since after
reading Rob Kleffner's <a
href='https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/blog/static/stack-languages-talk-notes.pdf'
target='_blank'>talk notes</a>. Prior to this project, I had a sense of what
the sundry constructions were, but writing a <a
href='type_systems.html'>type-checker</a> drew clearer lines between all these
different patterns.</p>
	<p>We're casting off for <a href='https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html'
target='_blank'>Desolation Sound</a> in a few days. Most afternoons are spent
stocking up <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> with enough food to last us until we
make our way back south next autumn. I'm eager to depart.</p>

	<h2>2023-05-01 Concurrency All The Things</h2>
	<p>I recently watched David Ungar's <i>Everything You Know About Parallel
Programming Is Wrong</i> talk, which lead me to read Tony Hoare's
<i>Communicating Sequential Processes</i>, after which I felt inspired to
consider <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel computing</a> once more,
and soon found myself taking a detour to play with the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_(programming_language)'
target='_blank'>OCCAM programming language</a>, and revisit threads in Uxn.</p>
	<p>As a side-project, unrelated to threads, I made a pixel-perfect
implementation of the classic Macintosh Note Pad application, so I could keep
notes throughout the day and that turned out to be a fantastic aid to
collecting passing thoughts. While building it, I also had a chance to
implement text-wrapping in a project with very few moving parts and better
understood how to handle text selection, where the boundary of a selection ends
up being before the original anchor, and implemented it in <a

	<h2>2023-04-22 Structured Editing</h2>
	<p>These past few months, I've explored <a href='computation.html'>playful
things</a> to do with programming that might not directly serve a purpose, or
at least, one wouldn't come across them without seeking them out specifically,
and I've collected some of those seemingly useless, ideas into a talk and
submitted it to the <a href='https://www.thestrangeloop.com'
target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conference happening in September.</p>
	<p>Also, while I consider <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a> to be a kind of
<i>disassembler</i>, I wanted to see if I could build something that would let
me go from a source file to an assembled rom, and back again. I figured that
being able to recover a project from a rom and its symbols file has important
potential in terms of data preservation. To make this possible, I modified the
<a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> to include comments, and was able to
complete the back and forth I wanted.</p>
	<p>This allowed me to experiment with something called <a

there, and didn't return until the fall. We left with stores bursting with <a

without the need to resupply.</p>

<p>The year was beginning and I hadn't entirely made up my mind about <a

want to keep on using, as it often goes with such projects, but the year came
and went without ever finding myself wanting to program in any other

	<p>Continuing my recent experiments with the <a

emulator</a>, I decided to repurpose it and turn it into an entirely
virtualized step-debugger. It is called <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>,
after <a href='https://github.com/randrew/uxn32' target='_blank'>Uxn32</a>'s

<a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> specification that will allow the
various emulators and debuggers to add labels to addresses when throwing errors
and warnings.</p>
	<p>As I was learning to use the Soroban to do elementary level multiplications, I

	<p>We've sailed ourselves into somewhat of an internet deadzone, where my evenings consist of lying in the hammock hung between the jib and the mast, thinking about what sort of an <a href='operating_systems.html'>operating system</a> I'd like for myself; what would be both realistic for the Uxn platform, and the limits of my own aptitude for realizing it.</p>

	<h2>2022-07-16 Slideshow Tech 2000</h2>
	<p>I haven't had it in me to start new projects these past two weeks, so I've instead revisited projects in need of care; namely <a href='https://100r.co/site/adelie.html' target='_blank'>Adelie</a> which was until now undocumented, leaving people to guess at how things worked. It has been nice to see some terrific projects made with it, like <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/@l3kn/108641034195971494' target='_blank'>tower of hanoi</a>, and these <a href='https://social.weho.st/@dvn/108630529793221806' target='_blank'>gorgeous</a> <a href='https://mstdn.social/@JotaEmese/108620021297292173' target='_blank'>slides</a>.

	<p>The more I try to imagine what resilient software might look like, the more shortcomings I find in <a href='roms.html'>Varvara roms</a>, namely, the ones that rely entirely on external <a href='documentation.html'>documentation</a>. So, I decided to try and begin to tackle this problem by adding a menu navigation <a href='manifest.html'>manifest</a> to each one, which not only makes the application self-documenting, but also improves accessibility.</p>

	<p>We've arrived in Desolation Sound and met up with friends. We spend the long afternoons rowing the dinghy along the shoreline and exploring the thickly forested coast. I went ahead and assigned a glyph to each Uxn opcode, to make an <a href='uxntal_alphabet.html'>Uxntal Alphabet</a>, it adds a wonderful conlang aspect to the project. I'm hoping to turn this into a little graphical assembler at some point.</p>

	<p>I couldn't stop thinking about the idea of a <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>Uxntal Sign Language</a>. So, with Rekka's help, I began assigning hand gestures to numbers, operators and modes.

	<p>We are finally making our way north toward Desolation Sound and the Broughton Archipelago. We are spending these late spring days anchored between high mountains, revisiting ideas for projects we conceived of this last winter, but decided to leave for a later time. I've been fascinated by how an entire computing paradigm can emerge from the primitives of combinatory logics, my recent thoughts have been populated by these <a href='logic.html'>strange talking birds</a>.</p>

	<h2>2022-04-30 Uxn Specs</h2>
	<p>I felt frustrated by the development of Uxn this week. It reminded me of the difficult period in Orca's development when it was beginning to be actively used, meanwhile the last few operators were being finalized. Folks would raise hell each time operators were moved around and it made finalizing the spec extremely painful.</p>

	<p>To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the Uxn project, in
which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is
about the virtual machine itself, the <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>second
one</a> is about a personal computer and the last one might be about the
language design. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have
have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>

<h2>2021</h2>

<p>The pandemic restrictions forced us to stay at one place, if only for a moment. To stop running and possibly build something, to spend more time with the same people and to become familiar with our surroundings. Every year is meant to be my <a href='https://www.raptitude.com/2018/12/why-the-depth-year-was-my-best-year/' target='_blank'>depth year</a>, every January, I tell myself that this time, finally, I will look deeper into things. I typically don't follow through, and this year might not have been as deep a year as I had hoped, but I can say that my understanding of a few specific things have deepened.</p>

<p>By the year's end, I, along with a handful of amazing people, had brought a little <a href='uxntal.html'>programming language</a> into the world, it cannot do much at all, but building this project brought me closer to understanding the deeper questions I had about programming, especially how human-language maps to symbols that computers can understand.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/399.jpg'/>

<p>Between the air that's hard to breath due to forest fires, and the water rationing that stops us from filling up our tanks, the tumbling down of everything has, to my surprise, not paralyzed me as much as I expected. It has been a constant creative force that pushed me through the year to learn about food preservation, water purification, insulation, heating, and various endeavors that I had previously overlooked, and that might come in handy would things keep on deteriorating.</p>

<p>Among the more trivial things that brought me joy this year, I've successfully grown a large lion's mane mushroom aboard the boat, worked on a wonderful tribute of the <a href='catclock.html'>catclock</a> with Rekka, did plenty of <a href='origami.html'>origami</a> with our friend's kids and played accordion for the first time.</p>

<p>For the year of 2021, Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang, was my favourite <a href='reading.html'>book</a>. The Lobster was my favourite <a href='watching.html'>movie</a>. Tamaryn's Dreaming The Dark was my favourite <a href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

	<h2>2021-10-30</h2>
	<p>Decided to stop doing daily drawings and port <a href='donsol.html'>Donsol</a> instead. I had it all planned out in my head before starting, I went ahead and completed the port within just a few days. The work was done on a Pinebook Pro, revealing a few issues with <a href='left.html'>Left</a>, so I spent some time optimizing the text-editor so it would run faster.</p>

<article>
	<h2>2021-09-30</h2>
	<p>Rewrote Dexe to be compatible to the latest changes to Varvara. I'm unsure what to do about Oscean's twtxt and RSS feeds, generating them in Uxntal will be hard, especially the date conversion. Maybe I could build the now page's body from the twtxt feed, but if I did, I would loose the <a href='varvara.html'>Arvelie</a> timestamps and links. Picked up <a href='moogle.html'>Moogle</a> again, cleaned up the codebase.</p>

<h3>15S</h3>
<article>
	<h2>2021-09-14</h2>
	<p>The grey weather gives us only a few hours of solar power each day, so we alternate between cleaning and doing other things, such as <a href='origami.html'>origami</a>. I've been optimizing <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, trying to make it run faster, inspired by the recent optimizations of Noodle. </p>
	<ul>

<h3>15R</h3>
<article>
	<h2>2021-08-30</h2>
	<p>Currently rewriting <a href='oscean.html'>Oscean</a> in Uxntal, as an experiment to see how far I can push Uxn, and explore what a <i>wiki from first principles</i> might even look like. A few features have yet to be ported, but the main components are done. We're slowly sailing North toward Vancouver to see friends, we left Saturna for Ladysmith and Silva Bay, Pino has engine problems, again. </p>

<h3>15Q</h3>
<article>
	<h2>2021-08-14</h2>
	<p>We're anchored near <a href='canada.html'>Saturna</a>, it has been nice to
work offgrid again. I've started porting <a
href='paradise.html'>paradise</a> in Uxntal, it would be nice to port <a
href='oscean.html'>Oscean</a> at some point too.</p>
	<p>After 16 years of daily journaling and tracking, I am finally stopping. I
believe that the problems I was attempting to tackle, such as moodswings and
the lack of focus, have been fixed and the data gathered in these recent years
reveals nothing new or actionable. A bi-monthly format where I write a few
sentences on my recent interests might be more practical.</p>
	<p>Let's begin, once again.</p>
