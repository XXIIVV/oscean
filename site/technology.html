Inside capitalism, the critical moment is specifically where technology meets capital: who gets to own this <i>capital</i>; the "factory without the worker".</p><p>The end of work, or <i>the end of jobs</i>, is an immediate reality. For most, who are currently subsisting through participation in the wage labour system, this is also end of getting paid and able to "not die". The idea that <i>for every job at the bottom closed by technology, there's one opening at the top</i> is ridiculous.</p><q>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country, dividing logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a precise fraction of the state's profit.</q><h3>technocracy</h3><ul><li><b>Sybil attack</b>: An attacker subverts the reputation system of a P2P network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.</li><li><b>Siren Servers</b>: Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the server concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data center. Alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses.</li><li><b>Paradox of tolerance</b>: States that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.</li><li><b>The Veil Of Ignorance</b>: Behind this veil, you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities, position in society, sex, race, nationality, or individual tastes. All individuals are simply specified as rational, free, and morally equal beings.</li><li><b>Behavioral sink</b>: A term used to describe the collapse in behavior(stress, alienation, hostility, sexual perversion, parental incompetence, and rabid violence) which resulted from overcrowdedness in an experiment on mice, drawing parallels with societal collapse found in the human Megalopolis.</li><li><b>Dunbar's Number</b>: A suggested cognitive limit of 150, to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.</li></ul><h2><a href='moloch.html'>moloch</a></h2><p><i>I, the Monster, am doing the thinking, run toward the destiny I have planned for you, run without stopping to the end of the road where I have put the Bomb or the complete degradation of humanity — we're almost there, run with your eyes closed, it's easier, shout all together Justice — Patriotism — Progress — Intelligence — Dignity — Civilization.</i></p><p><i>What, you aren't running — you're sailing around on your boat, just to think! and you dare complain into your tape recorder saying what you have in your heart just wait, you poor fool, I'm going to shoot you down in flames guys who get angry and speak out are very dangerous for me, I have to shut them up if too many of them started getting angry, I wouldn't be able to drive the human cattle as I please, their eyes and ears blocked by Pride, Stupidity and Cowardice and I'm in a hurry to get them, bleating and satisfied, where I want them to go.</i></p><p>And I know all that is no dream, everything beautiful and good that men have done they built with their dreams but back there, the Monster has taken over for men, it dreams in our place. It would have us believe that man is the centre of the universe, that all rights are his on the pretense that he invented the steam engine and lots of other machines, and that he will someday reach the stars if he just hurries a little before the next bomb.</p><h5>Bernard Moitessier, The Long Way</h5><q>They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven!

The <i>liminal</i> experiences of tribal cultures – in which ritual is a collective process for navigating moments of change – are different from the <i>liminoid</i> experiences available in modern societies, which resemble the liminal, but are choices we opt into as individuals, like a night out at the theatre. This distinction comes with a suggestion that true liminality, the collective entry into the liminal, is not available within a complex industrial society.</p><p>Perhaps this has been true. The consequences of that very complex industrial society are now bringing us to a point where we get reacquainted with true liminality. We begin to recognise that we now face a crisis which has no outside. The planetary scale of our predicament makes it as much a collective experience as anything faced by the tribal cultures.<a href='https://dark-mountain.net/2016-you-want-it-darker/' target='_blank'>~</a></p><q>Whoever must play, cannot play.</q><h5>—James P. Carse, Finite and Infinite Games</h5><h3>collapsology</h3><ul><li><b>Uncivilisation</b>: It is to accept the world for what it is and to make our home here, rather than dreaming of relocating to the stars, or existing in a Man-forged bubble and pretending to ourselves that there is nothing outside it to which we have any connection at all.</li><li><b>Dark Mountaineers</b>: Artists who generally ascribe to the idea that climate collapse cannot be stopped or reversed, a forum in which one can be honest about their sense of dread and loss.</li><li><b>Inhumanism</b>: A shifting of emphasis and significance from man to not-man, the rejection of human solipsism and recognition of the transhuman magnificence.</li><li><b>Anthropocene</b>: A proposed epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change.</li><li><b>Simple pastoral</b>: Merely another of our many vehicles of escape from reality, that doesn’t interrogate civilisation's main driving forces, but instead focuses on returning to rural simplicity.</li><li><b>Object Oriented Ontology</b>: A school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects, that objects exist independently of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans.</li><li><b>Freudian death drive</b>: The hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state.</li><li><b>Agrilogistics paradox</b>: A maniacal urge to live, and to diminish stimulation, that ends up being self-destructive, generating mass extinction, through global warming, that it was designed to avoid.</li><li><b>Existential Risk</b>: An event that could cause human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanity's potential.</li><li><b>Feedback Loops</b>: The results of global warming are complex. Much of the destruction caused by warming also contributes: the albedo effect, forest fires, melting ice, and ocean acidification all mean more greenhouse gases and less places for carbon to go. It remains unclear how these systems will interact with ongoing anthropogenic warming.</li><li><b>Albedo Effect</b>: Warming caused by the disappearance of ice which previously reflect heat back into space.</li><li><b>Fossil Capitalism</b>: A theory suggesting the modern economy is actually just a system that runs on fossil fuel.</li><li><b>Tragedy of the Commons</b>: A situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.</li></ul><h3>collapsology links</h3><ul><li><a href='https://dark-mountain.net/about/manifesto'>Dark Mountain Manifesto</a></li><li><a href='https://meanjin.com.au/essays/unearthed'>Unearthed</a></li><li><a href='https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf'>Policymakers</a></li><li><a href='https://forum.effectivealtruism.org'>Effective Altruism Forum</a></li><li><a href='https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf'>Deep Adaptation</a></li><li><a href='http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comic/energy-slaves'>Energy Slaves</a></li><li><a href='https://orionmagazine.org/article/dark-ecology/'>Dark Ecology</a></li></ul></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
