<h2>Technology is the active human interface with the material world.</h2>

<p>Suppose one were to write a revolutionary book. If it is to be published, it
must enter into the framework of the technical organization of book publishing.
It must appeal to some public and hence must refrain from attacking the real
taboos of the public for which it is destined. No one will publish a book
attacking the real religion of our times, by which I mean the dominant social
forces of the <a href='technocracy.html'>technological society</a>.</p>

<h3>Surrogate Activities</h3>

<p>We indulge in the continual debasement of our attention and energy, get
emotionally giddy as its squandered to the ignorant masses. We indulge in its
<a href='commodity.html'>narcistic promotion</a>, revel in slowly becoming a
greater center of attention; a center that becomes defined by various
artificially created <a href='simulacra.html'>boundaries</a>. </p>

<p>The social media user does not post for enjoyment, they enjoy the indulgent
masochism of its dopamine exhaustion, they indulge in it as they do a deep
autumn depression, with an unconsciously mechanical action which draws them
from their potential as a Being. Stripped to the core there is nothing new
here, what is found once more is one's lust for sleep.<a

<q>A long-continuing day was given to them for the life they loved so much, for
they died not by grievous ills consumed, but as o'ercome by sleep.</q>

<p>I asked one Amish person why they didn't use automobiles. He simply smiled and
turned to me and said, "Look what they did to your society." And I asked "what
do you mean? "Well, do you know your neighbor? Do you know the names of your
neighbors?" And, at the time, I had to admit to the fact that I didn't.</p>

<p>And he pointed out that my ability to simply bypass them with the windows
closed meant I didn't have to talk to them. And as a result, I didn't. </p>

	<p>If we are surrounded by life, why is the universe silent? Shouldn't the whole
universe be a noisy social media feed, everyone vying for everyone else's
attention? The dark forest theory explaining that communication, because it
reveals our existence to others, is a sign of stupidity rather than
intelligence.</p>
</article>

<p>Sciences become respectable by confining themselves to the feasible, and that
is precisely what computing science did: it focussed its attention on the
intellectual challenge of how to specify and design reliable software systems
of great sophistication. In doing so, it came to a few unescapable conclusions,
all clarifying and inspiring for the computing scientists involved, and each of
them unacceptable to the world at large, that refused to part from its
cherished dreams.<a

<p><b>The end of work</b> is the upcoming abstraction and machine automation of
mostly all that is currently understood as work. Inside capitalism, the
critical moment is specifically where technology meets capital: who gets to own
this <i>capital</i>; the "factory without the worker".</p>

<p>The end of work, or <i>the end of jobs</i>, is an immediate <a
href='collapse.html'>reality</a>. For most, who are currently subsisting
through participation in the wage labour system, this is also end of getting
paid and able to "not die". The idea that <i>for every job at the bottom closed
by technology, there's one opening at the top</i> is ridiculous.</p>

<q>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country, dividing
logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a precise
fraction of the state's profit.</q>

<img src='../media/refs/technocracy.jpg'/>

<img src='../media/refs/goodjob.png' style='float:left;margin-right:15px'/>

<p>The state did not appreciate the journeymen's associations' tendency to <a
href='sabotage.html'>strike</a>, nor their ability to <a
href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>move as they pleased</a> when work conditions
were unfavorable. The state's response was to take over the management of the
construction sites, merging all the divisions of labor together in the supreme
distinction between the intellectual and the manual, the theoretical and the
practical.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/forster.jpg' style='float:right; margin-left: 30px'/>

<p>By separating intellectual and physical labor the state took power away from
both types of workers. The manual laborers could then only build what others
had planned and the planners no longer had the capacity to build anything at
all.</p>

<h3>Manufacturing Scarcity</h3>

<p>People have a native capacity for healing, consoling, moving, learning,
building their houses, and burying their dead. Each of these capacities meets a
need. The means for the satisfaction of these needs are abundant so long as
they depend primarily on what people can do for themselves, with only marginal
dependence on commodities.</p>

<p>These basic satisfactions become scarce when the social environment is
transformed in such a manner that basic needs can no longer be met by abundant
competence. The establishment of radical monopoly happens when people give up
their native ability to do what they can do for themselves and for each other,
in exchange for something "better" that can be done for them only by a major
tool.</p>

<q>Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would
set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave
them.</q>

<p>Lauderdale pointed out that the only way to increase <i>private riches</i>
was to reduce what he called <i>public wealth</i>, or the commons. To enclose
things that were once free so that people have to pay in order to access them.
To illustrate, he noted that colonialists would often even burn down trees that
produced nuts and fruits so that local inhabitants wouldn't be able to live off
of the natural abundance of the earth, but would be forced to work for wages in
order to feed themselves.</p>

<p>As a first step, new standards were set for the construction of dwelling
units. These standards were intended to protect the person who purchases a
house, from exploitation by the industry producing it. Paradoxically, these
same standards deprived many more people of the traditional opportunity to
house themselves.</p>

<p>Preservation of the sick life of medically dependent people in an unhealthy
environment became the principal business of the medical profession. Natural
immunity, and traditional culture could not cope. On a world-wide scale,

domesticated life within an increasingly more costly, man-made, scientifically
controlled environment. </p>

<p>There is an underlying apprehension that technology has failed so far to make
our lives positively rich and that it is not a matter of continuing the
enrichment through technology but of first ushering it in. The fear that the
positive and shining goal of technology has after two centuries of gigantic
efforts remained distant and may even slip from sight lends a note of urgency
if not panic to the pronouncements of those who urge that we continue to
promote technology.</p>

<h2>For when the whole vast world of men shall be — By waters ruined, ye'll wail a dreadful song.</h2>

<p><i>I, the Monster, am doing the thinking, run toward the destiny I have planned for you, run without stopping to the end of the road where I have put the Bomb or the complete degradation of humanity — we're almost there, run with your eyes closed, it's easier, shout all together Justice — Patriotism — Progress — Intelligence — Dignity — Civilization.</i></p>

<p><i>What, you aren't running — you're sailing around on your boat, just to think! and you dare complain into your tape recorder saying what you have in your heart just wait, you poor fool, I'm going to shoot you down in flames guys who get angry and speak out are very dangerous for me, I have to shut them up if too many of them started getting angry, I wouldn't be able to drive the human cattle as I please, their eyes and ears blocked by Pride, Stupidity and Cowardice and I'm in a hurry to get them, <a href='shining_wire.html'>bleating and satisfied</a>, where I want them to go.</i></p>

<p><i>And I know all that is no dream, everything beautiful and good that men have done they built with their dreams but back there, the Monster has taken over for men, it dreams in our place. It would have us believe that man is the centre of the universe, that all rights are his on the pretense that he invented the steam engine and lots of other machines, and that he will someday reach the stars if he just hurries a little before the next bomb.</i></p>

<h2>Compulsory Consumption</h2>

<p>They drive cars because they consider the pollution created by one car
insignificant, and because they do not feel personally deprived of freedom when
they drive. It is also difficult to be protected against monopoly when a
society is already littered with roads, schools, or hospitals, when independent
action has been paralyzed for so long that the ability for it seems to have
atrophied, and when simple alternatives seem beyond the reach of the
imagination.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the city are in touch with thousands of systems, but only
peripherally with each. They knows how to operate the TV or the telephone, but
their workings are hidden from them. Learning by primary experience is
restricted to self-adjustment in the midst of packaged <a
href='commodity.html'>commodities</a>. They feel less and less secure in doing
their own thing. Cooking, courtesy, and sex become subject matters in which
instruction is required.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/luminal.jpg' alt='Covenant - Sequencer Beta'/>

<q>When they want you to buy something <a href='shining_stones.html'>they will call you</a>. When they want you to die for profit they will let you know.</q>

<p>No depersonalisation, no degradation of man is more effective than the one that seems to preserve the freedom of the personality and the rights of that individual. Each separately undergoes the conditioning process, which works just as well in the cages where individuals are now confined, despite their loneliness, in their <a href='tenth_hand.html'>millions of isolated units</a>.</p>

<p>This treatment is inconspicuous since it is presented as fun, since it conceals from its victim the sacrifices it demands of her and leaves her with the illusion of a private life or at least of a private space. As the power of machines increases, the more the role of persons decreases to that of mere consumers.</p>

<p>Year by year it was served with increased efficiency and decreased intelligence. The better a man knew his own duties upon it, the less he understood the duties of his neighbour, and in all the world there was not one who understood the monster as a whole. Those master brains had perished. They had left full directions, it is true, and their successors had each of them mastered a portion of those directions. But Humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. <a href='../docs/machine_stops.txt'>~</a></p>

<p>Symbols, signs, and simulations had become so all-encompassing, that it is

quality inherent in the mode of disappearance of meaning, in the mode of
volatilization of meaning in operational systems.</p>

<p>What we consider to be social reality is indefinitely reproducible and
extendable, with the copy indistinguishable from the original, or perhaps
seeming more real than the original. </p>

<p>The modern progress economy dealt in technological potential and progress, whereas the postmodern innovation economy dealt in windows of opportunity that open and close. No one cares about your product; we care about your adoption. No one cares about what your <a href='technology.html'>technology</a> does; we care about what problems it solves for users, and how fast you can grow. </p>

<p>Production and the ideals of production have been so <a href='technocracy.html'>successful</a>, that a new stage is reached, a stage that has a certain banality or triviality where the ideal disappears and becomes so commonplace that it does not have meaning associated with it.</p>

<p>The ability to kill thousands at the press of a button was no longer matched by the ability to take the measure of the calamity wrought. This <i>promethean lag</i> often anesthetized our faculties, including our ability to fear the plight that threatens us, for the simple reason that we cannot know what we cannot understand or represent concretely or morally to ourselves. These limitations in us induced a state of irresponsibility, a form of nihilism in action that maintained us as atomized individuals while we labored toward our own irrelevance and extinction.</p>

<p>The <a href='moloch.html'>desert of cities</a> is equal to the desert of sand — the jungle of signs is equal to that of the forests — the vertigo of simulacra is equal to that of nature — only the vertiginous seduction of a <a href='collapse.html'>dying system</a> remains, in which work buries work, in which <a href='commodity.html'>value</a> buries value. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>When one weighed material comforts against something as ineffable, and unpriceable, as integrity, standing up for one's beliefs could seem like a utopian gesture — a moral luxury that was <i>admirable</i>, perhaps, but quite pointless.</p>

<p>Because to tell the truth, nothing happens anymore. Nothing any longer has the time to happen. There is no duration left for anything to unfold in. Nothing can anchor itself in the world long enough to make sense. While the present still has a duration, the hyperpresent no longer does.</p>

<p>The world is going digital, we're told, and someday there will even be digital real estate inhabited by people in digital clothes drinking digital orange juice extracted with digital juicers.

<h3>Homely</h3>

<p>The family, severed from the work world, was no longer a place where he could
prove and enact genuine competence and resourcefulness. The family more and
more became a mere setting for consumption, and since consumption makes no
demands of skill and discipline, there was less and less of substance to which
the parents needed or were even able to initiate their children.</p>

<p>To surrender one's children to an alien force of education and information is
a tendency that runs parallel with the diminishment of authority that parents
suffer. And both tendencies are reinforced by the technological desire to be
disburdened of an annoying task, which child rearing sometimes is, by a
dependable machinery that television provides with unequaled perfection;
neither naps, books, toys, nor babysitters can pacify a child as steadily and
reliably as television.</p>

<h3>Reeducating the unwilling working class toward consumptive habits</h3>

<p>There is a cartoon where a middle-aged woman stands in front of a chest of
frozen dinners in a supermarket, holding up two packages, looking a little
puzzled; and she says to her husband: "For the big day, Harv, which do you want?
The traditional American Christmas turkey dinner with mashed potatoes, giblet
gravy, oyster dressing, cranberry sauce and tiny green peas or the old English
Christmas goose dinner with chestnut stuffing, boiled potatoes, brussels sprout
and plum pudding?" Harvey looks skeptical and a bit morose. The world of
bountiful harvests, careful preparations, and festive meals has become a faint
and ironical echo. </p>

<p>Mabel is asking Harvey whether he would rather consume this aggregate of
commodities or that. To consume is to use up an isolated entity without
preparation, resonance, and consequence. To engage us, the vision of a cartoon
must remain within hailing distance of reality. If Mabel were young, slim, and
pretty, and her speech just a little more cheerful, no further changes would be
needed for a standard promotion of technological food. </p>

<h2>We live in a time of social, economic and ecological unravelling. All around us are signs that our way of living is already passing into history.</h2>

<p>Collapse is the transition away from a globalized, hyperconnected and materially-abundant society, toward a state of greater precariousness, lesser abundance, potentially reaching a stage of existential risk for our species. </p>

	<li><b>Dark Mountaineers</b>: Artists who generally ascribe to the idea that climate collapse cannot be stopped or reversed, a forum in which one can be honest about their sense of dread and loss.</li>
	<li><b>Anthropocene</b>: A proposed epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change.</li>
	<li><b>Simple pastoral</b>: Merely another of our many vehicles of escape from reality, that doesn’t interrogate civilisation's main driving forces, but instead focuses on returning to <a href='pastoral.html'>rural simplicity</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Freudian death drive</b>: The hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state.</li>
	<li><b>Fossil Capitalism</b>: A theory suggesting the modern economy is actually just a system that runs on fossil fuel.</li>
	<li><b>Age of Salvage</b>: When a civilization breaks down, the most efficient economies are most often those that use its remains as raw material.</li>
	<li><b>Cornucopianism</b>: Crackpot optimism, hopium.</li>
	<li><b>Drawdown</b>: Stealing resources from the future.</li>
	<li><b>Wishcycling</b>: Where people are hoping that something is recyclable and therefore they put it in with their recycling.</li>
	<li><b>The Jackpot</b>: The mundane cataclysm of modernity itself. It is hundreds of millions of people driving to the supermarket in their SUVs, flying six times a year, and eating medicated animals for dinner.</li>

<p>If green energy investment grows, leading to an increase in total energy production, the price of energy will decrease, which means that large manufacturers will make more of the <a href='commodity.html'>commodities</a> they are producing, rendering their products cheaper in hopes that consumers will buy more of them. Consequently, total energy usage will increase. This applies to energy from all available sources, especially the most established ones—fossil fuels.</p>

Et ces nouveaux dieux ne reculant devant rien<br/>
Étaient prêts à tout pour arriver à leur fins<br/>
Pour s'enrichir encore ils ont rasé la Terre<br/>
Pollué l'air ambiant et tari les rivières<br/>
<br/>
Mais au bout de cent ans des gens se sont levés<br/>
Et les ont averti qu'il fallait tout stopper<br/>
Mais ils n'ont pas compris cette sage prophétie<br/>
Ces hommes là ne parlaient qu'en termes de profits<br/>

<q>They suppose Hesiod as knowing most, who indeed did not recognize that day
and night were one.</q>
