<main><h2>Answers to commonly asked questions about audio.</h2>

<h4>What inspired you to play music?</h4>
<p>I knew that I should want to write my own <a href='audio.html'>music</a> when I was at a chiptune concert, I realized at that moment that I could write music with non-traditional and custom-made instruments.</p>

<h4>When were you first introduced to chiptune music?</h4>
<p>At the Gamma Festival in Montreal, Bubblyfish was the first performing chiptune act that I ever saw.</p>

<h4>What kind of music do you play and why?</h4>
<p>I tend to navigate the space between ambient and industrial music, I write starkly contrasted rhythmic music as I find it best to describe the environments explored in the songs.</p>

<h4>What themes are you trying to uncover in your music?</h4>
<p>Most of the music I write as <a href='aliceffekt.html'>aliceffekt</a> is about a character's travels across the frigid scapes of this fictional world called the <a href='neauismetica.html'>neauismetica</a>, on this foreign planet called <a href='dinaisth.html'>dinaisth</a>.</p>

<h4>Why did you decide to accompany your music with visuals?</h4>
<p>The visuals came first, and I wrote the music to accompany the drawings. So the music merely accompany the visuals.</p>

<h4>Do you have a set of tracks you play regularly?</h4>
<p>I tend to write music for specific events that occur in the Neauismetica, and when I perform live, I pick moments which best fit with the other performers.</p>

<h4>What is your approach when you perform live?</h4>
<p>It depends, sometimes it's improvisational, like the <a href='telekinetic.html'>telekinetic</a> show. Or sometimes it's procedural, like the <a href='ehrivevnv_studies.html'>ehrivevnv_studies</a>, where I merely make sure that everything is tuned properly. Sometimes I mix old songs and focus on building interesting visuals if the venue allows for it. As of late, I have been livecoding, where the song writing is done as a performance.</p>

<h4>How do you approach songwriting?</h4>
<p>I tend to write the song in my head entirely, and put it down in one setting. I often write music about the Neauismetica, it's a kind of mental place, a pool of endless musical idea I can visit and explore, it's where most of the songs come from.</p>

<h4>When performing live, what's your setup like?</h4>
<p>It varies, I've written a couple of shows to be performed with a <a href='studio.html'>specific synth</a>, or a specific hardware like with the LeapMotion. Typically, I just use a combination of midi controllers and livecoding.</p>

<h4>What instruments do you play?</h4>
<p>None. I've never been too not much interested in music interpretation, my love is for composition and synthesis.</p>

<h4>Where does the name Aliceffekt comes from?</h4>
<p>Alice Effekt was a <a href='https://youtu.be/VSKXfDMpqns?t=51m8s' target='_blank'>track by Drome</a> that I liked a lot when I started writing music. My goal was to write music just like it. But it has since evolved into something else.</p>
