<h2>Porporo is an operating system for Varvara.</h2>

<p>Consider a network of <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> instances, each with
its own event handlers, private memory, capable of sharing data and trigger
vector events in other instances via <b>wires</b> connecting the device pages.</p>

<p>Porporo is designed to allow for roms to work both independently on systems
where multi-tasking is unnecessary, and as a coordinated network of nodes in
cases where programs needs to be connected with each without an underlying OS.</p>

<p>This thin software layer merely allows for the spawning and destruction of
instances, as well as routing of device ports between instances. For example,
connecting a keyboard application's Console/write port, to another
application's Controller/key port, would trigger the Controller/vector.
Effectively making for an on-screen keyboard.</p>
