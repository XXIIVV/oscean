<h2>Lunar Arithmetic is a variance of arithmetic without carry.</h2>

<p>In Lunar Arithmetic, the addition is defined as the <code>max()</code> of
digits in an arbitrary <a href='bases.html'>base</a>(in this case <a
href='decimal.html'>decimal</a>), for example: 4 + 5 = 5.</p>

<p>Multiplication is defined as the <code>min()</code> of digits, for example: 6
+ 7 = 6.</p>

<h3>Squre Numbers(n × n)</h3>

<h3>Prime Numbers</h3>

<p>In the usual arithmetic, a <a href='primes.html'>prime number</a> is defined
as a number whose only possible factorisation is 1 × n. Analogously, in the
lunar arithmetic, a prime number is defined as a number whose only
factorisation is 9 × n where 9 is the multiplicative identity which
corresponds to 1 in usual arithmetic.</p>
