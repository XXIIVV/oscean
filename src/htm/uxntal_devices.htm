<h2>Uxntal Devices</h2>

<p>Uxn is non-interruptible, <b>vectors</b> are locations in programs that are
evaluated when certain events occur. A vector is evaluated until a BRK opcode
is encountered. Uxn can communicate with a maximum of 16 devices, each device
has 16 <b>ports</b>, each port handles a specific I/O message. Ports are mapped to the
devices memory page, which is located outside of the main addressable
memory.</p>

<p>All programs begin by executing the <b>reset vector</b> located at
<code>0x100</code>. The content of the stacks are preserved between vectors,
but it is discouraged to use the stacks to pass <a
href='uxntal_doors.html'>data between vectors</a>.</p>

<pre>
@on-reset <i>( -> )</i>
	<i>( set vector )</i>
	;on-mouse .Mouse/vector DEO2
	BRK

@on-mouse <i>( -> )</i>
	<i>( read state )</i>
	.Mouse/state DEI ?&on-touch
	BRK

&on-touch <i>( -> )</i>
	<i>( A mouse button is pressed )</i>
	BRK
</pre>

<p>For example, the address stored in the <a
href='varvara.html#mouse'>Mouse/vector</a> ports points to a part of the
program to be evaluated when the cursor is moved, or a button state has
changed. </p>
