<h2>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.</h2>

<p>I've collected here a handful of notes on the various languages that I've had the opportunity to use in the past.</p>

<p>Nowadays, my focus is principally on concatenative languages, namely <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a>. In concatenative languages all expressions denote functions, and the juxtaposition of expressions denotes function composition, which I found was a way of programming that most resonated with how I think.</p>

<p>Point-free programming is a programming paradigm in which function definitions do not identify the arguments on which they operate. Instead the definitions merely compose other functions, among which are <a href='logic.html'>combinators</a> that manipulate the arguments.</p>
