<h2>Bitrot: Unity games.</h2>

<article>
	<p>Sadly, a lot of the source for these games were lost in the sudden death of
my working computer, and are only listed here for memory's sake. Some
additional Unity games are available under <a
href='collegiennes.html'>collegiennes</a>. A few videos of these games can be
found here and there across youtube.</p>

<p>A lot of the abandonned projects were made using the <a
href='unity.html'>Unity game engine</a>, it was a convenient way to bundle
cross-platform applications. The engine's APIs were in flux at the time, and
the rapid migration from one version to the next became more trouble than it
was worth. I also had difficulty versioning, and preserving copies, of these
massive project files. The engine's transition toward a monthly fee had me
looking elsewhere to host my projects.</p> <p>As of January 2015, all Unity
development was abandoned.</p>
