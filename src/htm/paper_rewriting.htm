<h3>Rewriting Machine Emulator</h3>

<p>Programs are written as a <a href='rewriting.html'>set of rules</a>, and the initial content of a unordered bag. During evaluation, rules are tested in a sequence from the first to the last, when the bag contains a rule's left-side, the symbols are replaced by those in the right-side, and search for the next rule starts back again from the beginning. </p>

<p>The advantages over the <a href='paper_register.html'>register machine</a> are that it has only one operation, and does away with textual language altogether. To learn more, see the <a href='pocket_rewriting.html'>Pocket Rewriting Computer</a>.</p>
