<h2>Symbol files are debug information about an assembled rom.</h2>

<p>A symbols(*.sym) file is a binary format that contains a series of symbols in
the format: an absolute addresses, where the first byte is the most significan
byte, the second is the least significant byte, followed by a null-terminated
string. They are generated by Uxntal assemblers, such as <a
href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, and are used by debugging tools, such as <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxndis' target='_blank'>uxndis</a> and <a
href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>, which do not otherwise have access to a
program's labels.</p>
