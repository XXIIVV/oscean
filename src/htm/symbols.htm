<h2>Symbol files are debug information about an assembled rom.</h2>

<p>A symbols(*.sym) file is a binary format that contains a series of symbols in the format: an absolute addresses, where the first byte is the most significan byte, the second is the least significant byte, followed by a null-terminated string. They are generated by Uxntal assemblers, such as <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, and are used by debugging tools, such as <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>, which do not otherwise have access to a program's labels.</p>
