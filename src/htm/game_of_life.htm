<p>The universe of John Horton Conway's Game Of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: </p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Any <b>live cell</b> with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
	<li>Any <b>dead cell</b> with three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>
