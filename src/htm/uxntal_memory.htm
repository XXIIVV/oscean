<h2>Uxntal Memory</h2>

<p>There are 64kb of <b>addressable memory</b>. Roms are always loaded at 0x0100,
which is the address of the <a href='uxntal_devices.html'>Reset Vector</a> and
where evaluation begins. During boot, the stacks, device and addressable
memories are zeroed. During a soft-reboot, the content of the zero-page is
preserved.</p>

<p>Memory is <b>big-endian</b>, when writing or reading a short from memory, the
position is that of the high-byte. The low-byte of a short written at 0xffff
wraps to 0x0000.</p>

#3456 #0400 STA2 <span style='float:right'>0x0400=34, 0x0401=56</span>
#0400 LDA <span style='float:right'>34</span>
</pre>

<p>The <b>zero-page</b> is the memory located below 0x0100, its
purpose is to store variables that will be accessed often, or needs to be
preserved across a soft-reboot. It is sligthly faster to read and write from
the zero-page using the LDZ and STZ opcodes as they use only a single byte
instead of a short. This memory space cannot be pre-filled in the rom prior to
initialization. The low-byte of a short written at 0xff wraps to 0x00.</p>
