<h2>Uxntal Memory</h2>

<p>There are 64kb of <b>addressable memory</b>. Roms are loaded at 0x0100, which
is the address of the <a href='uxntal_devices.html'>reset vector</a>. During
boot, the stacks, device and addressable memories are zeroed. During a
soft-reboot, the content of the zero-page is preserved.</p>

<ul>
	<li>An <b id='absolute'>Absolute Padding</b>, like <kbd>|100</kbd> moves
the program generation to an address specified by a number or label.</li>
	<li>A <b id='relative'>Relative Padding</b>, like <kbd>$18</kbd> moves
the program generation by a distance specified by a number or label.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>zero-page</b> is the memory located below 0x0100, its
purpose is to store variables that will be accessed often, or needs to be
preserved across a soft-reboot. It is sligthly faster to read and write from
the zero-page using the LDZ and STZ opcodes as they use only a single byte
instead of a short. This memory space cannot be pre-filled in the rom prior to
initialization. The low-byte of a short written at 0xff wraps to 0x00.</p>

<p>Memory is <b>big-endian</b>, when writing or reading a short from memory, the
position is that of the high-byte. The low-byte of a short written at 0xffff
wraps to 0x0000.</p>
