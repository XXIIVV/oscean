<h2>We will face this reality honestly and learn how to live with it. </h2>

<p>We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of
problems in need of <a href='technology.html'>technological</a> or political
solutions. We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in
the stories we have been telling ourselves.</p>

<p>The <b>myth of progress</b> tells us that we are destined for greatness, that
we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called
<i>nature</i>, which we have now triumphantly subdued.</p>

<p>It came to be understood among the people of our culture that life in <i>the
wild</i> was governed by a single, cruel law known as "kill or be killed." In
recent decades, ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In
fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the
wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the
community as a whole. This system of laws has been called, among other things,
the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and <i>animal
ethics</i>.</p>

<p>Collapse won't be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning
off the air-conditioning. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one:
understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront
this problem, and the sooner we realize there's nothing we can do to save
ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal
humility, to our <a href='collapse.html'>new reality</a>.</p>

<p>An Adaptationist is someone who understands and respects the science, and
recognises, based on history, that humanity has not cooperated on what what
needed to be done to address climate change. Adaptationists, in realising this,
make active changes in their own lives & within their own local community
because that is all they have left.</p>

<q>Absolute security for existence is unattainable, and no wise man will pursue it; for if we must go to these lengths in the attempt at self-preservation we shall die before ever we have begun to live. Reasonable security is attainable; but it is attainable without any wide study of Science.</q>
