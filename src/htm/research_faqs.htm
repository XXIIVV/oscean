<h2>Answers to commonly asked questions about research.</h2>

<h4>What are the most important concepts that you impart in your works?</h4>
<p>A lot of my work deal with foreignness and adaptiveness, some of the most
romantic ideas that one will find in my work is that of explorers wandering the
remains of a long extinguished civilisation, and trying to make sense of
it.</p>

<h4>Why do you release free software?</h4>
<p>Being away from accessible internet connectivity, the most practical mean for
us to develop and release projects is via <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar'
target='_blank'>the bazaar model</a>, where the code is often maintained by
others while we are away, and so as to not capitalize unfairly on all the help
that we receive, we decided to only accept donations.</p>

<h4>Why do you release open-source software?</h4>
<p>Being incapable of sitting through a class back in high-school, most of the
learning that I was able to do was from looking at other people's sources and
trying to make sense of the way they think and understand the reasons for
solutioning in that particular way. For an ecosystem of <a
href='utilities.html'>tools</a> to be truly resilient, individuals must be able to
<a href='lasting.html'>repair, maintain and inspect</a> the software that they
use.</p>

<h4>Why is journaling important to you?</h4>
<p>I keep records of everything I make, and everything I consume. The idea is to
better understand my creative patterns, and to predict changes in mood and
interest. Ultimately, the goal is to plan more efficiently, to spend my time
with more efficacy and to work less.</p>
