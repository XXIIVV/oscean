<h2>Anarchy means not necessarily the absence of order but an absence of rule.</h2>

<p>Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems
of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism,
ableism, <a href='vegan.html'>speciesism</a>, and religion. </p>

<p>It is founded on the observation that since only a few are wise enough to
rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others. Anarchists wish to
create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation.</p>

<p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without
borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for
the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment. </p>

<p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long
as each allows all to do the same. A just society is one in which liberty for
one person is constrained only by the demands created by equal liberty for
another.</p>

<p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by
obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the
various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the
satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a person.</p>

<q>The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.</q>
<cite>Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed</cite>

<p>Anarchism directs its forces against the greatest foe of all social equality;
namely, the State, organized authority, or statutory law. Just as religion has
fettered the human mind, and as property, or the monopoly of things, has
subdued and stifled people's needs, so has the State enslaved the spirit,
dictating every phase of conduct. It matters not whether it is government by
divine right or majority rule. In every instance its aim is the absolute
subordination of the individual.</p>

<p>The State is the economic master of its servants who
would either remain true to their political faith and lose their economic
support, or they would cling to their economic master and be utterly unable to
do the slightest good. In all states there is the same principle of justice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of the stronger.</p>

<p>Elections serve to represent us to each other at our worst, distilling the most offensive, cowardly, and servile aspects of the species. Many people who would never personally wrest a mother from her children are capable of endorsing deportation from the privacy of a voting booth, just as most people who eat meat could never work at a slaughterhouse.<a href='https://crimethinc.com/2016/11/09/president-trump-countdown-to-apocalypse' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>The contention that a standing army and navy is the best security of peace is
about as logical as the claim that the most peaceful citizen is he who goes
about heavily armed.</p>
