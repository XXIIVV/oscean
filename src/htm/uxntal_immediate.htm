<h2>Immediate opcodes</h2>

<p>Immediate opcodes are operations which do not take items from the stack, but
read values stored <i>immediately</i> after the opcode in the program's memory.
Uxntal has 4 immediate opcodes: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>literal</b> <kbd>LIT</kbd>.</li>
	<li id='jmi'>The <b>jump</b> <kbd>!routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JMP</kbd>.</li>
	<li id='jci'>The <b>conditional</b> <kbd>?routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JCN</kbd>.</li>
	<li>The <b>subroutine</b> <kbd>routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JSR</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The immediate jump opcodes are slightly faster than their standard opcode
counterparts, but do not have modes and cannot be used to do pointer
arithmetic. The address value of the immediate opcodes are stored in memory as
relative shorts, enabling routines making use of these opcodes to be moved
around in the program's memory.</p>

<p><b>Quoting</b> is the act of <a
href='https://limited.systems/articles/uxntal-quoting/'
target='_blank'>deferring an operation</a>, for example, by keeping the address
to a routine on the stack and using it later, by <i>unquoting</i> it, with the
<kbd>JMP2</kbd> or <kbd>JSR2</kbd> opcodes. To learn more about pointer
arithmetic, see <a href='uxntal_labels.html#lambdas'>lambdas</a>.</p>
