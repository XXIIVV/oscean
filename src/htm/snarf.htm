<h2>Snarf files are the clipboard standard for Varvara software.</h2>

<p>A <code>.snarf</code> file contains a clipboard buffer, programs will handle clipboard operations by writing to that external invisible file. You can see support coverage <a href='roms.html'>here</a>. To quickly write to the snarf file before pasting:</p>

<pre>
cat > .snarf
</pre>

<p>The <b>cut</b> operation deletes the selected text from the screen and puts it in the snarf buffer, <b>snarf</b> copies the selected text to the buffer without deleting it, <b>paste</b> replaces the selected text with the contents of the buffer.</p>

<pre>
|0100 @snarf/length

@snarf/copy ( data* length* -- )
	;&path .File/name DEO2
	.File/length DEO2
	.File/write DEO2
	JMP2r

@snarf/paste ( addr* -- length* )
	;&path .File/name DEO2
	;&length .File/length DEO2
	;&buf .File/read DEO2
	.File/success DEI2
	JMP2r

&buf $&length
</pre>

<q>Snarf is the term for Copy on the <a href='plan9.html'>Plan9</a> operating system. The operation is not to copy but to snarf. It's called snarf because snarf is what it does. There is no design document.</q>
