<h2>Uxntal Strings</h2>

<p>Uxntal has superficial support to convert raw <a href='ascii.html'>ascii characters</a> into bytes. The string token begins with the double-quote character <kbd>"</kbd>, there is no escaping of special characters. For example, a linebreak and null-terminated "Hello world" looks like:</p>

<pre>
"Hello 20 "world. 0a $1</pre>

<p>This token type can also be used to inline characters, for example, the following example will push the <a href='hexadecimal.html'>hexadecimal</a> value 0x61 on the stack before printing the letter "b".</p>

<pre>
LIT "a INC .Console/write DEO
</pre>
