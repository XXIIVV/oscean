<h2>Uxntal Numbers</h2>

<p>Uxntal uses <b>only</b> lowercase unsigned <a
href='hexadecimal.html'>hexadecimal numbers</a>. There are different types of
numbers:</p>

<ul>
	<li id='lithex'>A <b>Literal Hex</b>, like <kbd>#ab</kbd>, denotes a number that will be
pushed on the stack when evaluated, it is made of a <a
href='uxntal_reference.html#lit'>LIT</a> opcode that matches its length,
followed by a Raw Hex number. It is either 2 or 4 characters in length.</li>
	<li id='rawhex'>A <b>Raw Hex</b>, like <kbd>aa</kbd>, is the standard textual
encoding of data in a program, generally speaking these are more often loaded
than evaluated. It can be anything, an opcode, an ascii byte, an address, part
of a sprite. It is either 2 or 4 characters in length.</li>
</ul>
