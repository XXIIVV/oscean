<h2>Uxntal Numbers</h2>

<p>Uxntal uses only lowercase unsigned <a href='hexadecimal.html'>hexadecimal
numbers</a> of either 2 or 4 characters in length. There are two types of
numbers:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Lithex</b>, like <code>#ab</code>. It specifies a number that will be
pushed on the stack when evaluated, it is made of a <a
href='uxntal_reference.html#lit'>LIT</a> opcode that matches its length,
followed by a rawhex number.</li>
	<li><b>Rawhex</b>, like <code>aa</code>. It is the standard textual
encoding of data in a program, generally speaking these are more often loaded
than evaluated. It can be anything, an opcode, an ascii byte, an address, part
of a sprite.</li>
</ul>
