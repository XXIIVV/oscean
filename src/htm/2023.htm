<h2>2023</h2>

<p>It's funny how I can go from being utterly terrified at the onset of a
project such as the <a href='https://100r.ca/site/electrical_refit.html'
target='_blank'>total rewiring</a> of <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, to looking
back thinking that it wasn't at all as hard as you expected, and having that
familiar realization that that twinge of fear is more often about
<i>starting</i> than it is about doing the task itself. </p>

<p>As a little gift to ourselves, Rek and I ported <a
href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> to <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>, which
somewhat ensures that this little world to remains playable now that the
previous builds have begun to have mixed success running on recent operating
systems.</p>

<img loading='lazy' src='../media/diary/816.jpg'/>

<p>Rek and I were invited to do a residency at LEÑA, and we sailed to our dream
destination, the breath-taking <a
href="https://100r.ca/site/princess_louisa_inlet.html" target="_blank">Princess
Louisa Inlet</a>. I had, once again, the opportunity of crossing the US by
train, eastward this time, with a bunch of amazing people heading to the last
of the <a href='https://100r.ca/site/computing_and_sustainability.html'
target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conferences. I got a tattoo of my favourite
demon, Stolas, by my friend and favourite tattoo artist <a
href='https://ritualdust.com/tattoo/' target='_blank'>Lizbeth</a>. </p>

<p>After a short fling with <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel
computing</a>, I realized that it was more trouble than it was worth for the
scale of projects that interested me. I've added lambdas to Uxntal, which was
certainly the single greatest UX improvement to the language since its
creation.</p>

<p>This crazy and wonder-full year ended with the publication of Rek's latest
novel <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>, and as the year and projects come
to an end, we are now turning our gaze back to the horizon for the next year,
and our next projects.</p>

<p>For the year of 2023, Maurice Renard's Le Peril Bleu, was my favourite <a
href='reading.html'>book</a>. Coline Serreau's La Belle Verte was my favourite <a
href='watching.html'>movie</a>. Cimerion's Contresort was my favourite <a
href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

	<h2>2023-12-28 Lisp</h2>
	<p>I've been taking it easy for the last few days of the year, cooked a lot,
walked a lot. I've been re-reading SICP and idly poking at implementing a <a
href='lisp.html'>Lisp</a> system in the style of <a
href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>. I don't have any specific goal for it beyond
exploring low-level symbolic computing, but who knows where these things might
lead.</p>
	<p>After watching an excellent documentary about the <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxRi34PqWo' target='_blank'>Newton</a>,
I found myself reading about the various ways to convert hand-written letters
into their digital representations, and soon found myself fascinated enough
that I just had to invent my own little shorthand <a

it.</p>

	<h2>2023-09-25 Strange Loop Or Die Tryin'</h2>
	<p>On the eve of the talk, I sit half-awake waiting for my first real meal since
leaving Victoria to arrive, it's been two hours, blatter is coming down hard on
this very loud, and very understaffed, and only available vegetarian place
within walking farness from the hotel. And, my voice is shut, the talk is in a
few hours.</p>

<p>I normally am a really careful planner when it comes to giving these sorts of
technical talks, you wouldn't catch me going out the night before.</p>

<p>I had assumed that the train from Seattle would either carry their one
vegetarian meal on the menu, or accommodate. After a first day of eating cold
bread loaves with margarine, and an altercation with an uncompromising
attendant on the second day, I managed to secure myself a "<i>Steamed Russet
Potato A-la Tomato Sauce</i>" for the third.</p>

<p>I had also assumed that the venue would carry palatable vegan options, or that
I could cook my own. After missing the Strange Loop meal service twice in a
row, due to talk scheduling conflicts, I managed to queue long enough to
acquire one of the last remaining scoops of an awful vegan soup. I promptly
returned to stealing whole fruits from the hotel gym and eating them in my
room, which I was content with. The problem that wasn't apparent at first was
that eating sweets all day kept me up all night. </p>

<p>Despite these mistakes in preparing properly for the road leading to the talk,
I managed to show up on stage on time, give an (hopefully) entertaining
presentation at Strange Loop 2023. I'd love to give a sunderly thank to Jack
Rusher for the tea that brought my voice back, and Josh Morrow for letting me
borrow their laptop and install Uxn on it for the presentation.</p>

	<h2>2023-09-09 Solresol</h2>
	<p>Now that the first pass of proof-reading for <a

cleaning up some of the worlding aspects of the book, which include <a
href='hako.html'>congames</a>, conlangs and even <i>conrecipes</i>. One of
Lupin's dialects can be whistled, and as to encode the various poems of the
story into pitches, we decided to pick the <a href='solresol.html'>Solresol</a>
constructed language as a suitable candidate.</p>
	<p>Not previously knowing the language, I have spent the past few days neck-deep
in digital archeology excavating some of the language's vanishing documents
from the Wayback Machine and transcribing them in a format that will allow me
to translate the texts. While I'm at it, I'm planning on translating the <a

	<p>While implementing changes to <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a>, I noticed
how many single-purpose labels were used merely to hop over short lengths of
code, enough that having ran of ideas for names to called them, I would default
to things such as <code>&skip</code>, <code>&continue</code> or even
<code>&ok</code>. The solution was to create anonymous labels, and as to be
capable of nesting them, I ended up inadvertently adding <a

code readability, and as a side effect allowed for the rapid creation of tree

	<h2>2023-05-01 Concurrency All The Things</h2>
	<p>I recently watched David Ungar's <i>Everything You Know About Parallel
Programming Is Wrong</i> talk, which lead me to read Tony Hoare's
<i>Communicating Sequential Processes</i>, after which I felt inspired to
consider <a href='parallel_computing.html'>parallel computing</a> once more,
and soon found myself taking a detour to play with the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_(programming_language)'
target='_blank'>OCCAM programming language</a>, and revisit threads in Uxn.</p>
	<p>As a side-project, unrelated to threads, I made a pixel-perfect
implementation of the classic Macintosh Note Pad application, so I could keep
notes throughout the day and that turned out to be a fantastic aid to
collecting passing thoughts. While building it, I also had a chance to
implement text-wrapping in a project with very few moving parts and better
understood how to handle text selection, where the boundary of a selection ends
up being before the original anchor, and implemented it in <a
href='left.html'>Left</a>.</p>

	<h2>2023-04-22 Structured Editing</h2>
	<p>These past few months, I've explored <a href='computation.html'>playful
things</a> to do with programming that might not directly serve a purpose, or
at least, one wouldn't come across them without seeking them out specifically,
and I've collected some of those seemingly useless, ideas into a talk and
submitted it to the <a href='https://www.thestrangeloop.com'
target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conference happening in September.</p>
	<p>Also, while I consider <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a> to be a kind of
<i>disassembler</i>, I wanted to see if I could build something that would let
me go from a source file to an assembled rom, and back again. I figured that
being able to recover a project from a rom and its symbols file has important
potential in terms of data preservation. To make this possible, I modified the
<a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> to include comments, and was able to
complete the back and forth I wanted.</p>
	<p>This allowed me to experiment with something called <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor'
target='_blank'>structured editing</a>, in which you modifying the underlying
structure, symbols and bytecode of a program, and not its structural
representation.</p>

	<p>The past two weeks have flown by, between finishing <a

the summer, each day I fall into bed completely exhausted. But the game is
nearly finished now, there are fewer and fewer bugs, and most of my time is

again, and fallen for Sato's <a

code is a nightmare but I feel that with a bit of work, and a better division
between the interpreter and virtual machine, this could turn out to be
something very fun.</p>
	<p>After watching Alan Kay's <a

1997</a> talk, I went and read <a href='reading.html'>Smalltalk-80: Bits of
History, Words of Advice</a> and I've been fascinated with it. It goes in
details about their approach to the implementations of the <a

	<h2>2023-03-13 Residency at Biosonic</h2>
	<p>Spent the week at the <a href='https://lenaresidency.com'
target='_blank'>LEÑA residency</a> collaborating with audio-visual artists.
They call it a <i>retreat</i>, but really, I returned from Galiano more
exhausted than when I left. It was well worth it tho, as I rarely allow myself
to play music for more than an hour or two at a time.</p>
	<p>I've had a bit of time to kill between rehearsals, and whenever I had a few
minutes to myself, I'd pour over the <a href='../docs/memo528_cadr.html'
target='_blank'>Lisp Machine memos</a>. It occurred to me that the
<i>byol</i>-type books really ought to teach about targetting Lisp
architectures(or at the very least, something in the vein of <a
href='secd.html'>SECD</a> abstract machines), instead of implementing <a
href='lisp.html'>Lisp</a> on top of imperative languages, which does a
disservice to the entire exercise.</p>

	<p>I will be staying on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galiano_Island'

	<p>The weather has been absolute garbage and so has been a great help in
advancing the <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> port. Not only is the project
pushing <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> further than it previously ventured, but it
is equally pushing the tools used in its creation. The building of the game has
had me do some significant improvements to <a

	<p>Meanwhile, I've also tried to bring <a href='potato.html'>potato</a> to a

it should be able to assemble and run the assembled rom, a state to which I am

Pino</a>, it has been a more challenging project than we had hoped but we will

	<p>I've read Koopman's <a

Machines: The New Wave</a> and it inspired me to experiment with other virtual
machine designs, namely that of the NOVIX NC4016. But after two weeks of
experiments, I returned to writing Uxntal, partly since I do not feel limited
in the realization of my ideas with my current stack, and partly because these
sort of systems make for extremely obfuscated assembly languages. That being
said, I can't seem to shake the craving to experiment with the <a
