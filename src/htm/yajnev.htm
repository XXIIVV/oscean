<h2>The death of Yajnev engulfed Vetetrandes in an opaque impenetrable
lock.</h2>

<p>Yajnev was an <a href='actors.html'>actor</a> who's nervous system spanned
all locally occurring events, steering the course of Time. Approaching Yajnev
would effectively vaporize and assimilate anything and anyone into the tendrils
of its thoughts.</p>

<p>The space surrounding the corpse of Yajnev is still <a href='vetetrandes.html'>haunted</a> by echoes of its
processing the event. The effect of <a href='andes.html'>Andes</a> forcing its
way into <a href='dinaisth.html'>Dinaisth</a> has caused the collapse by
forcing a new event into the <a href='soies.html'>Soies</a>.</p>
