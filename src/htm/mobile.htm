<h2>Bitrot: Mobile games and tools.</h2>

<article>
	<p>In another life, I was building mobile apps, I thought it was a neat platform,
until the size of the toolchains exploded, and the tools themselves became near
unsable due to bugs and crashes; ultimately, Apple's requiring the latest
hardware to push to their store is what did me in. Never again.</p>

<p>As I sailed across the Pacific Ocean, it became increasingly clear that
building software for Apple's <a href='mobile.html'>mobile</a> ecosystem was
unsustainable due to the frequent and massive <a
href='obsolescence.html'>toolchain updates</a>, and the need for the latest
generation of Apple devices to successfuly sign and publish to the
platform which are quite hard to aquire in far flung countries.</p>
<p>Trying to maintain our iOS devices outside of western countries, or updating
X Code via expensive or spotty internet was something we could no longer
afford. As of march 2019, all iOS development was abandoned.</p>
