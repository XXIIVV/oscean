<p>I've had the immense fortune of living many lives, I spent my twenties playing
musician and artist, my thirties, programmer and long-distance sailor. For as
far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a generalist, and I've
never regretted it. Somewhere between natural inclinations, inspiration,
influences, and some more direct forces, I've tried to feel at the changes in
the wind and find my place in the world accordingly.</p>

<p>My late twenties happened when rent prices were rising at a faster pace than I
could keep up with doing what I enjoyed, coinciding with a market saturated
with affordable second-hand vessels from the aging boomer generation. So, two
vagabonds with relatively few means and a bit of technology, could find a
sailboat and travel the world, not long ago this would have been unthinkable
without considerable sponsorship. This makes me wonder just for how much longer
this door will remain open until distances grow further apart once again.</p>

<p>We read of the golden age of blue water cruising and find their voyages to be
as irreproduceable as our own are to others, just nine years ago, mainly due to
bureaucracy, depopulation, aging infrastructure and destructive weather
events. Countries are growing more insular, the weather more erratic and
dangerous, the cost of living siphoning people's capacity to escape its
whirlpool.</p>

<q>The meaning of <i>fitness</i> is the capacity of an
organism to survive.</q>

<p>At what feels like the tumultuous tail end of the anacyclotic cycle,
considering this global trajectory, and our choosing this way of life, does not
speak highly of our ability to plan against a changing environment and position
ourselves favorably to it. </p>

<p>A decade of arts has given me a fervor to live and wanting to learn, a decade
on the water has afforded me space to acquire some green skills. I spent near
40 years inside my head cultivating a place I liked, in circles where the body
has always ever been the domain of vanity alone, thinking myself to be a
generalist where in truth, only ever affecting a generalism of a highly specific
sort.</p>

<p>It's a cruel twist that cognitive function decline is most acute on those
around me who have exercised in all the ways of mind, but none of the body.</p>

<q>The philosopher's body also must be well prepared for work because often virtues 
use it as a necessary tool for the activities of life.</q>
