<h2>A music player.</h2>

<p>This player was originally created to test an experimental feature of <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11' target='_blank'>uxn11</a> that allows
Varvara to communicate with other non-uxn programs, but has since become the
only music player that I use. It works as a client to <a
href='https://www.mpg123.de/' target='_blank'>mpg123</a>. The project was
created in collaboration with <a href='http://plastic-idolatry.com/erik'
target='_blank'>d6</a>.</p>
