<h2>Solsifasi Siresol</h2>

<p>There are multiple dialects of Solresol, and they each have minor differences
which are mostly edits to the vocabulary and a small amount of the grammar.
</p>

<ul id='dialects'>
	<li><b>Fran√ßois Sudre</b>: Original specs. <i>Fasol</i>: Voici.</li>
	<li><b>Boleslas Gajewski</b>: Revised specs. <i>Fasol</i>: Why?</li>
	<li><b>Modern Solresol</b>: Community specs. <i>Sisol</i>: Honorific Particle.</li>
	<li><b>Symmetric Solresol</b>: Wiktopher specs. <i>Mido</i>: Your(sing).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Modern Symmetrical</b> tries to address a few issues at once. Its central
focus is to facilitate the learning of the language and its communication by
clustering similar words together by using Solresol's syllabic inversion, so
one need only learn <i>wet</i> to know how to spell <i>dry</i>.</p>

<p>The second point is to remove artifacts of the French language
present in the grammar, as well as terms pertaining to Christianity in the
vocabulary, to begin approaching the language's original point of doing away
with at least some linguistic biases.</p>

<article>
	<p>Which dialect are we speaking? To know if you are communicating with another
speaker of Symmetric, you may say "<i>dosol, soldo?</i>" to mean "We, ours?"
which have no obvious meaning in other dialects.</p>

<h3>Symmetry</h3>

<p>A unique feature of Solresol is that it can express opposite meanings by reversing the words, syllable by syllable. For instance <i>fala</i> means <i>good or tasty</i>, and <i>lafa</i> means <i>bad</i>. Unfortunately, this attribute was used only occasionally in the table of two syllables, mostly abandoned in the table of tree syllables, and altogether ignored beyond.</p>

<article>
	<p><b>Symmetrical</b>: Every word of the two-syllables table is reversible except for the question words. Pronouns are reversed to their possessive forms(you, yours). And most non-special words of three syllables are reversible.</p>
</article>

<p>A few symmetrical words from the original dictionary were kept unchanged even if their polarity(the orientation of the positive term) seems to be contrary to the rest: dolami, dolasol, dosimi, redomi, mifado, ...</p>

<h3 id='gender'>Gender</h3>

<p>In traditional Solresol, grammatical categories are distinguished by the position of an accent over the notes, indicating that the note should be lengthened. A verb is unstressed throughout, the noun is stressed on the first note, the adjective on the next-to-last, and the adverb on the last. The feminine is marked by final stress. By default, all animate nouns and pronouns imply that they are of male sex. To differentiate the female sex, a bar, hyphen or macron is added to the final syllable of the corresponding article or the word itself. </p>

<p>As of modern Solresol, pronouns no longer change depending on gender. The
definitions of <span class='note_si'>si</span><span class='note_la'>la</span>
and <span class='note_la'>la</span><span class='note_si'>si</span> are part of
an honorifics system inspired by what is used in <a
href='japanese.html'>Japanese</a>; both are gender-neutral titles, one to be
respectful, and one to be affectionate.</p>

<article>
	<p><b>Symmetrical</b>: Is non-gendered, the original versions of the language overly emphasize words like mister and bachelor, present in the two letter estate, these are all gone.</p>
</article>

<h3 id='christianity'>Christianity</h3>

<p>There are many words of 3 syllables relating to Christianity(the trinity, holy virgin, christ, etc..) cluttering the two and three syllable dictionary, for the language to be inclusive, it should do away with these altogether.</p>

<article>
	<p><b>Symmetrical</b>: These words have been replaced to make space for symmetries.</p>
</article>

<h3 id='numerals'>Numerals</h3>

<p>Solresol has the french habit of forming numbers like ninety five, by using
eighty-fifteen. </p>

<article>
	<p><b>Symmetrical</b>: These words have been left unchanged, seventy and ninety
have not been added. Adding them would not do much good, use extra word
allocations and offset Sudre's numbers. Perhaps a future reform will decide to
address this. Zero is <i>dodore</i>.</p>
</article>

<!-- Sudre planned to use seven words of one note, 49 words of two notes, 336 words
of three notes, 2268 words of four notes, and 9072 words of five notes. -->
