<h2>Modal is a programming language based on string rewriting.</h2>

<img src='../media/refs/soulages.png' style='float:right;width:200px' title='Pierre Soulages | Lithographie n°30 (1972)'/>

<p>Modal programs are represented as a series of substitution rules, applied to a given tree which gets
continually modified until no rules match any given part of the tree. The principale elements of modal are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href='#rules'>Rules</a>: &lt;&gt; left right</li>
	<li><a href='#registers'>Registers</a>: ?x, ?y, ?z</li>
	<li><a href='#trees'>Trees</a>: word, (a tuple), a (nested (list))</li>
</ul>

<p>The documentation below displays the examples as a series of rules, followed
by the rewriting steps in the following format:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; A rule

.. The input program
04 The result of applying rule #4
-1 The result of applying a lambda</pre>

<p>Modal's evaluation model is based on scanning from left-to-right across a string that represents a serialized tree. We only match from the start of the string, and if we can't find a rule that matches, we move one token or subtree forward. All rules match against the start of the string, and if one matches, the matched pattern is erased, and the right-hand side of the rule is written to the end of the string.</p>

<h3 id='rules'>Rules</h3>

<p>To define a new rule, start with <kbd>&lt;&gt;</kbd>, followed by a
<i>left</i> and a <i>right</i> statement, which is either a word, or a <a
href='#tree'>tree</a>. The program evaluation starts at the first character of
the string and walks through to the end trying to match a transformation rule
from that location:</p>

<pre>&lt;&gt; hello (good bye)  <i>This is a rule</i>

.. hello world       <i>This is program data</i>
00 good bye world    <i>This is the result</i></pre>

<p>Rules can be also be undefined using the <kbd>&gt;&lt;</kbd> operation that will try matching a previously declared rule's <i>left</i> statement:</p>

<pre>
<> cat owl
<> owl bat
<> owl rat
>< owl

.. cat 
00 owl 
02 rat
</pre>

<p>Modal is homoiconic, meaning that any string is a potential program and new rules can be
composed directly during the evaluation. For instance, here is a rule that defines
a new rules definition <a href='notation.html'>infix syntax</a>:</p>

<pre>
<> (?x -> ?y) (<> ?x ?y)
fruit_a -> apple
fruit_b -> banana
(apple banana) -> fruit-salad

.. fruit_a fruit_b
01 apple fruit_b
02 apple banana
03 fruit-salad</pre>

<h3 id='registers'>Registers</h3>

<p>Registers are single-character identifiers bound to an address in a pattern
used in rewriting:</p>

<pre>&lt;&gt; (copy ?a) (?a ?a)

.. copy cat
00 cat cat</pre>

<p>When a register is used in a pattern, and when we try
to match a given tree with a pattern, each register is bound to a
corresponding an address to the left of a rule, and referenced to the right:</p>

<pre>&lt;&gt; (swap ?x ?y) (?y ?x)

.. (swap fox rat)
00 (rat fox)</pre>

<p>When a register appears more than once in a rule, each instance is bound to
the first address, but differently named registers can still match on the same pattern:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; ((?x ?x ?x)) match3
&lt;&gt; ((?x ?y)) match2

.. (fox fox fox) (bat bat) (bat cat)
00 match3 (bat bat) (bat cat)
01 match3 match2 (bat cat)
01 match3 match2 match2
</pre>

<h3 id='trees'>Trees</h3>

<p>Trees can be found in rules and program data, they include words, registers
and nested trees. Rules can match specific trees and rewrite their content in a
new sequence.</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (rotate ?x (?y) ?z) (?y (?z) ?x)

.. rotate foo (bar) baz
00 bar (baz) foo
</pre>

<p>An efficient way to represent an array is to store information in
nested lists, it allows for rules to target specific segments of the list,
similarly to Lisp's car and cdr primitives. To print each element of such a
structure, we can use the following recursive rules:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (putrec (?: ?x)) (putrec ?: ?x)
&lt;&gt; ((putrec (?:))) (?:)

.. (putrec (a (b (c (d (e))))))
00 (putrec (b (c (d (e)))))
00 (putrec (c (d (e))))
00 (putrec (d (e)))
00 (putrec (e))
01 

<b>> abcde</b>
</pre>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<p>Let us build a logic system, starting by comparing two registers:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (eq ?x ?x) (#t)
&lt;&gt; (eq ?x ?y) (#f)

.. (eq fox bat)
01 (#f)
</pre>

<p>We can implement the truth tables by defining each case:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (and #t #t) #t &lt;&gt; (or #t #t) #t 
&lt;&gt; (and #t #f) #f &lt;&gt; (or #t #f) #t
&lt;&gt; (and #f #t) #f &lt;&gt; (or #f #t) #t 
&lt;&gt; (and #f #f) #f &lt;&gt; (or #f #f) #f
&lt;&gt; (not #t) #f    &lt;&gt; (not #f) #t

.. (or #f #t)
08 (#t)
</pre>

<p>Building on the comparison rule above, we can write conditionals with a ternary statement: </p>
<pre>
&lt;&gt; (ife #t ?t ?f) (?t)
&lt;&gt; (ife #f ?t ?f) (?f)
&lt;&gt; (print ?:) (?:)

.. ife #f (print True!) (print False!)
13 (print False!)
14 ()
</pre>

<h3 id='types'>Types</h3>

<p>Understanding how to use <i>typeguard</i> to reach a specific evaluation order is
important to become proficient with Modal. Creating a type system is merely a
matter of creating stricter rules expecting a specific grammar. Notice in the example below, how join-strings expects to match two String
typed words. Without typed inputs, the rule is not matched.</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (join-strings (String ?x) (String ?y)) (?x?y)

.. join-strings (String foo) (String bar)
00 foobar
</pre>

<h3 id='lambda'>Lambdas</h3>

<p>A <b>lambda</b> is created by using the <kbd>?(body)</kbd>
special register. Rules created that way exist only for the length of one
rewrite and must match what is found immediately after: </p>

<pre>
.. ?((?x ?y) (?y ?x)) foo bar
-1 bar foo
</pre>

<h3>Outgoing Events</h3>

<p>Sending a message is done with the <kbd>?:</kbd> special register, it sends a word or a tree to be handled by a device:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (print ?:) (?:)

.. print (hello world\n)

<b>hello world</b>
</pre>

<h3>Incoming Events</h3>

<p>Similarly, listening to incoming messages is done with the <kbd>?~</kbd> special register:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (?: print) (?:)
&lt;&gt; (READ ?~) ((You said: ?~ \n) print)

.. (READ stdin)

<b>You said: </b>
</pre>

<q><b>modal</b>(adj.): of, or relating to structure as opposed to substance.</q>

<h3>Special Registers Reference</h3>

<table border='1' class='registers'>
	<tr><th colspan='3'>IO</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Read</td><td>?~</td><td>Read from devices</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Send</td><td>?:</td><td>Send to devices</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='3'>Substrings</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Explode token</td><td>?(?* ?*) abc</td><td>a (b (c ()))</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Explode tuple</td><td>?(?* ?*) (abc def ghi)</td><td>abc (def (ghi ()))</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Unpack</td><td>?(?. ?.) (abc def)</td><td>abc def</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Join</td><td>?(?^ ?^) (abc def ghi)</td><td>abcdefghi</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <kbd>?*</kbd> special
register explodes a token or tuple into a nested list, and the <kbd>?^</kbd> register to join it back into a single word. Notice how the following program makes use the <a href='#types'>List
type</a> to ensure a specific evaluation order:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&gt; (reverse List () ?^) (?^)
&lt;&gt; (reverse (?*)) (reverse List (?*) ())
&lt;&gt; (reverse List (?x ?y) ?z) (reverse List ?y (?x ?z))

.. (reverse (modal))
01 (reverse List (m (o (d (a (l ()))))) ())
02 (reverse List (o (d (a (l ())))) (m ()))
02 (reverse List (d (a (l ()))) (o (m ())))
02 (reverse List (a (l ())) (d (o (m ()))))
02 (reverse List (l ()) (a (d (o (m ())))))
02 (reverse List () (l (a (d (o (m ()))))))
00 (ladom)
</pre>

<h3>sierpiński.modal</h3>

<p>To review everything documented above, here is a small program that prints the Sierpiński triangle fractal:</p>

<pre>
?(?-) (Rules)

&lt;&gt; (* (. > (. ?x))) (* (. (. > ?x))) 
&lt;&gt; (. (. > (* ?x))) (* (. (* > ?x))) 

?(?-) (Physics)

&lt;&gt; (Tri > (?x ?y)) (Tri (?x > ?y))
&lt;&gt; (Tri (?x > (?y ?z))) (Tri (?x (?y > ?z)))
&lt;&gt; (?x (?y > (?z ?n))) (. (?y (?z > ?n)))
&lt;&gt; ((?x > ())) (< ())
&lt;&gt; (Tri < (* ?^)) (?(?: ?:) (*?^ \n))
&lt;&gt; ((?x < ?y)) (< (?x ?y))

?(?-) (Print)

&lt;&gt; (Tri.join ?x ?:) (Tri > ?x ?:)
&lt;&gt; (Tri.dup ?x ?^) (Tri.join ?x ?^)
&lt;&gt; (Tri < ?x) (Tri.dup (. ?x) (?x \n))

?(?* (Tri < (?*))) ...............*...............</pre>
