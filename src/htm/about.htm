<h2>This wiki is a digital playground and personal logging system.</h2>

<p>Launched in 2008, this wiki was created to serve as a personal assistant for
managing a vast collection of records, including <a href='journal.html'>journal
logs</a>, <a href='index.html'>project notes</a>, and curated pages of <a
href='mirrors.html'>general knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>This type of website is a often referred to as a <i>Memex</i>, a living
document and archive of where one has been, and a tool for exploring where one
might go next.</p>

<q>Consider a future device, a sort of mechanized private library in which an
individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which may be
consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate
supplement to his memory.</q>
