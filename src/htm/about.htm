<h2>This wiki is a digital playground and personal logging system.</h2>

<p>Launched in 2008, this wiki was created to serve as a personal assistant for managing a vast collection of records, including <a href='journal.html'>daily logs</a>, <a href='index.html'>project notes</a>, and curated pages of <a href='mirrors.html'>general knowledge</a>.</p>

<p><a href='oscean.html'>Oscean</a> is implemented in the <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> assembly language and depends only on a <a href='uxn.html'>virtual machine</a> built to endure this age when digital information swiftly decays and vanishes. It is designed to evolve withs my needs and the relentless decay of technology.</p>

<p>This type of website is a often referred to as a <i>Memex</i>, a living document and archive of where one has been, and a tool for exploring where one might go next.</p>

<q>Consider a future device, a sort of mechanized private library in which an
individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which may be
consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate
supplement to his memory.</q>
