	<li>Pay more for foods grown or raised less intensively and with more care, eat less.</li>
	<li>Eat mostly plants, especially leaves. Cook, and if you can, plant a garden.</li>
	<li>Avoid food products with unpronounceable ingredients, or more than five in number.</li>

<q>Because when an organ is working properly, you don't feel it. If you see your eye, you've got cataract. If you hear your ears, you've got singing in your ears, you know, getting in the way of hearing. When you are fully functioning, you are unaware of the organ. When you're thinking clearly, your brain isn't getting in your way.</q>
