<h2>A spreadsheet editor.</h2>

<p>Nebu is a graphical spreadsheet editor for the <a
href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> system, designed to handle csv/tsv files</a>.
Math operations are done by specifying a rectangle range of cells, followed by
an operator. A range uses the colon character between two cell identifiers. A
cell does at most one operation, and the range must precede the cell and may
not include itself recursively.</p>

<pre>
A5:C7*
</pre>

<p>There are four basic arithmetic operator <kbd>+</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd>
<kbd>*</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd>, as well as <kbd>#</kbd> to get the number of non-empty cells
in a range, and <kbd>"</kbd> to concatenate strings. If an operator is not
specified, it will default to returning the sum.</p>

<q>Launches instantly, and weights less than an empty Excel file.</q>
