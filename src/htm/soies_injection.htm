<h2>A Soies Injection is a synthetic event forced into happening by compressing events outside of the Occurring.</h2>

<p>Injections are unnatural events found near the <a href='longest_end.html'>Longest End</a>, manufactured by condensing the potential events outside of the occurring timeline. The <a href='andes_castel.html'>Andes Castel</a>, found in <a href='laeisth.html'>Laeisth</a>, is a known <b>injection</b>, the <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Neon Hermetists</a> suggest that the <a href='ehrivevnv.html'>Ehrivevnv</a> is potentially an early experimental injection.</p>

<p>The <a href='soies_machine.html'>Soies Machines</a> are constructing large and often complex synthetic structures by retroactively, or teleologically, hijacking natural processes such as erosion or wind across immense spans of time, by consuming possible events neighboring a chain of occurrence to influence a gust of wind blow this way or that way, effectively shaping the world without being part of it.</p>
