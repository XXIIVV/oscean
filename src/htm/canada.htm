<h2>Despite being from there, Canada has become a travel destination to me.</h2>

<p>After spending 49 days at sea, sailing from <a
href='shimoda.html'>Shimoda</a>(Japan), we returned in Victoria(Canada),
effectively completing a 5 years circumnavigation of the <a
href='marquesas.html'>Pacific Ocean</a>, via <a href='new_zealand.html'>New
Zealand</a>. We have since sailed north from British Columbia to <a href='alaska.html'>Alaska</a> and back.</p>

<article>
	<p>One option for a new name that better reflects the geographical nature of British Columbia is the <a href='../docs/chinook_jargon.txt'>Chinook</a> term <i>Illaheechuk</i>, where <i>illahee</i> means land, and <i>chuk</i> means water, or "where land meets water".</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Chuck</b>: water</li>
		<li><b>Il'-la-hie</b>: Earth</li>
	</ul>

<q>There was not a single prospect that was pleasing to the eye.</q>
