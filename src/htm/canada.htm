<h2>Despite being from there, Canada has become a travel destination to me.</h2>

<p>After spending 49 days at sea, sailing from <a
href='shimoda.html'>Shimoda</a>(Japan), we returned in Victoria(Canada),
effectively completing a 5 years circumnavigation of the <a
href='marquesas.html'>Pacific Ocean</a>, via <a href='new_zealand.html'>New
Zealand</a>. We have since sailed north from British Columbia to <a href='alaska.html'>Alaska</a> and back.</p>

<p>One option that reflects the geographical nature of British Columbia is the <a href='../docs/chinook_jargon.txt'>Chinook</a> term Illaheechuk or Illahee Chuk, which means "where land meets water", where illahee (or il'-la-hie) means land, ground or earth and chuk means water.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>chuck</b>: water</li>
	<li><b>il'-la-hie</b>: Earth</li>
</ul>

<q>There was not a single prospect that was pleasing to the eye.</q>
