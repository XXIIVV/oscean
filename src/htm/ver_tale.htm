<h2>Ver'Tale is the northern equatorial region of Dinaisth.</h2>

<p>A gravitational anomaly makes structures temporarily weightless when <a href='aitasla.html'>Aitasla</a>'s orbit is parallel with the equator of <a href='dinaisth.html'>Dinaisth</a>. The combination of the oscillating downward pull and gale-force winds have created a terrain very hard to navigate. The Vertale islands, sometimes written <i>Ver'Tale</i>, are filled with the debris from the tunneling machines that once operated in <a href='es.html'>Es</a>.</p>

	<p>As far as <a href='aliceffekt.hmlt'>Aliceffekt</a> is concerned, the <i>Ver'Tale</i> name in some title indicates that the track is part of a recovered diary and may not exactly follow the album's timeline.</p>
