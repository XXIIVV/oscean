<h2>Forests are turned into paper and newspapers that call for the forests to be saved.</h2>

<p>The whole place has been crafted, complete with faux-authentic food crates
and coffee bean sacks, to recreate this farm-to-market experience that stopped
existing a long time ago.</p>

<p>Symbols, signs, and simulations had become so all-encompassing, that it is
not longer possible to distinguish the real and the symbol. Melancholy is the
quality inherent in the mode of disappearance of meaning, in the mode of
volatilization of meaning in operational systems.</p>

<p>What we consider to be social reality is indefinitely reproducible and
extendable, with the copy indistinguishable from the original, or perhaps
seeming more real than the original. </p>

<p>The modern progress economy dealt in technological potential and progress, whereas the postmodern innovation economy dealt in windows of opportunity that open and close. No one cares about your product; we care about your adoption. No one cares about what your <a href='technology.html'>technology</a> does; we care about what problems it solves for users, and how fast you can grow. </p>

<p>Production and the ideals of production have been so <a href='technocracy.html'>successful</a>, that a new stage is reached, a stage that has a certain banality or triviality where the ideal disappears and becomes so commonplace that it does not have meaning associated with it.</p>

<q>It has never been spread out, yet, they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.</q>

<p>The <a href='moloch.html'>desert of cities</a> is equal to the desert of sand — the jungle of signs is equal to that of the forests — the vertigo of simulacra is equal to that of nature — only the vertiginous seduction of a <a href='collapse.html'>dying system</a> remains, in which work buries work, in which <a href='commodity.html'>value</a> buries value. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>When one weighed material comforts against something as ineffable, and unpriceable, as integrity, standing up for one's beliefs could seem like a utopian gesture — a moral luxury that was <i>admirable</i>, perhaps, but quite pointless.</p>

<p>Because to tell the truth, nothing happens anymore. Nothing any longer has the time to happen. There is no duration left for anything to unfold in. Nothing can anchor itself in the world long enough to make sense. While the present still has a duration, the hyperpresent no longer does.</p>

<p>The world is going digital, we're told, and someday there will even be digital real estate inhabited by people in digital clothes drinking digital orange juice extracted with digital juicers.  People will play at the lives they once took seriously, lives that had once had heft and weight, and the juice content of juice will fall to zero. I suspect my old physical squeezer will still be working then, but the rest of my kitchen gear won't. Not much of it. I might not last, either. I fear I won't.</p>

<p>The psychic toll of goods that don't endure is that one loses faith the future will even come, and then one loses interest in it coming, for little that we own or use or cherish seems likely to be there with us to meet it. <a href='https://www.thefp.com/p/an-elegy-to-all-my-crap' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<h3>Homely</h3>

<p>The family, severed from the work world, was no longer a place where he could
prove and enact genuine competence and resourcefulness. The family more and
more became a mere setting for consumption, and since consumption makes no
demands of skill and discipline, there was less and less of substance to which
the parents needed or were even able to initiate their children.</p>

<p>To surrender one's children to an alien force of education and information is
a tendency that runs parallel with the diminishment of authority that parents
suffer. And both tendencies are reinforced by the technological desire to be
disburdened of an annoying task, which child rearing sometimes is, by a
dependable machinery that television provides with unequaled perfection;
neither naps, books, toys, nor babysitters can pacify a child as steadily and
reliably as television.</p>

<h3>Reeducating the unwilling working class toward consumptive habits</h3>

<p>There is a cartoon where a middle-aged woman stands in front of a chest of
frozen dinners in a supermarket, holding up two packages, looking a little
puzzled; and she says to her husband: "For the big day, Harv, which do you want?
The traditional American Christmas turkey dinner with mashed potatoes, giblet
gravy, oyster dressing, cranberry sauce and tiny green peas or the old English
Christmas goose dinner with chestnut stuffing, boiled potatoes, brussels sprout
and plum pudding?" Harvey looks skeptical and a bit morose. The world of
bountiful harvests, careful preparations, and festive meals has become a faint
and ironical echo. </p>

<p>Mabel is asking Harvey whether he would rather consume this aggregate of
commodities or that. To consume is to use up an isolated entity without
preparation, resonance, and consequence. To engage us, the vision of a cartoon
must remain within hailing distance of reality. If Mabel were young, slim, and
pretty, and her speech just a little more cheerful, no further changes would be
needed for a standard promotion of technological food. </p>
