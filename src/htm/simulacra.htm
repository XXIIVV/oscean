<h2>Forests are turned into paper and newspapers that call for the forests to be saved.</h2>

<p>The whole place has been crafted, complete with faux-authentic food crates and coffee bean sacks, to recreate this farm-to-market experience that stopped existing a long time ago.</p>

<p>Symbols, signs, and simulations had become so all-encompassing, that it is not longer possible to distinguish the real and the symbol. Melancholy is the quality inherent in the mode of disappearance of meaning, in the mode of volitilisation of meaning in operational systems.</p>

<p>What we consider to be social reality is indefinitely reproducible and extendable, with the copy indistinguishable from the original, or perhaps seeming more real than the original. </p>

<p>The modern progress economy dealt in technological potential and progress, whereas the postmodern innovation economy dealt in windows of opportunity that open and close. No one cares about your product; we care about your adoption. No one cares about what your <a href='technology.html'>technology</a> does; we care about what problems it solves for users, and how fast you can grow. </p>

<p>Production and the ideals of production have been so <a href='technocracy.html'>successful</a>, that a new stage is reached, a stage that has a certain banality or triviality where the ideal disappears and becomes so commonplace that it does not have meaning associated with it.</p>

<p>The ability to kill thousands at the press of a button was no longer matched by the ability to take the measure of the calamity wrought. This <i>promethean lag</i> often anaesthetised our faculties, including our ability to fear the danger that threatens us, for the simple reason that we cannot know what we cannot understand or represent concretely or morally to ourselves. These limitations in us induced a state of irresponsibility, a form of nihilism in action that maintained us as atomised individuals while we laboured toward our own irrelevance and extinction.</p>

<q>It has never been spread out, yet, they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.</q>

<p>The <a href='moloch.html'>desert of cities</a> is equal to the desert of sand — the jungle of signs is equal to that of the forests — the vertigo of simulacra is equal to that of nature — only the vertiginous seduction of a <a href='collapse.html'>dying system</a> remains, in which work buries work, in which <a href='commodity.html'>value</a> buries value. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>When one weighed material comforts against something as ineffable, and unpriceable, as integrity, standing up for one's beliefs could seem like a utopian gesture — a moral luxury that was <i>admirable</i>, perhaps, but quite pointless.</p>

<p>Because to tell the truth, nothing happens anymore. Nothing any longer has the time to happen. There is no duration left for anything to unfold in. Nothing can anchor itself in the world long enough to make sense. While the present still has a duration, the hyperpresent no longer does.</p>

<p>The world is going digital, we're told, and someday there will even be digital real estate inhabited by people in digital clothes drinking digital orange juice extracted with digital juicers.  People will play at the lives they once took seriously, lives that had once had heft and weight, and the juice content of juice will fall to zero. I suspect my old physical squeezer will still be working then, but the rest of my kitchen gear won't. Not much of it. I might not last, either. I fear I won't.</p>
<p>The psychic toll of goods that don't endure is that one loses faith the future will even come, and then one loses interest in it coming, for little that we own or use or cherish seems likely to be there with us to meet it. <a href='https://www.thefp.com/p/an-elegy-to-all-my-crap' target='_blank'>~</a></p>
