<h2>A prime number cannot be divided by any other number, apart from itself and one.</h2>


<table border='1' style='float:right; margin-left:25px;'>

<p>To find the prime factorization of a number, start by dividing the number by
the first prime number 2 and continue dividing by 2 until you get a decimal or
remainder. Then divide by 3, 5, 7, etc. until the only numbers left are prime
numbers. </p>

<p>Multiplying two numbers is the same as adding the counts of each prime
factors, and division is the same as subtracting the counts. For example, using
numbers made up of the 3 first primes(2, 3, 5), 2250 is equal to <code>2^1 x
3^2 x 5^3</code>.</p>

<p>Using prime factorization, one can find the GCD and LCM of two numbers.</p>
<ul>
	<li>48 = 2^4 × 3</li>
	<li>180 = 2^2 × 3^2 × 5</li>
	<li>LCM = 2^4 × 3^2 × 5 = 720</li>
    <li>GCD = 2^2 × 3 = 12</li>
    <li>Product = 720 × 12 = 8640</li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting part of primes is the ability to encode data, values can be
encoded as exponents to a number's prime factors, or as values to registers as
in <a href="fractran.html">Fractran</a>. For example, the letters of the word
"HELLO" can be stored as <a href='ascii.html'>ascii</a> exponents to the first
five primes:</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><td>H</td><td>E</td><td>L</td><td>L</td><td>O</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2^72</td><td>3^69</td><td>5^76</td><td>7^76</td><td>11^79</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The resulting number storing the values of each character of "HELLO": </p>

<pre>
1639531486723067852359816964623169016543137549

0000000000000000000000000 
</pre>

<p>Extra letters can be appended by multiplying with a number reducible with the
following prime, for example <code>* 13^33</code> would make our message
"HELLO!". Letters can also be removed by dividing by one of its factors, for
example <code>/ 3^69</code> would make our message "HLLO!".</p>
