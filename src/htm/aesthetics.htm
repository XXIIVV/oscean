<h2>Notes on focus and purpose.</h2>

<p>Years of <a href='horaire.html'>personal statistics</a>, recorded by way of
<a href='routine.html'>daily journaling</a>, revealed that my time spent
traveling inspired me more than any other of sort of stimuli that was being
recorded at the time. From this insight, I have oriented my entire life toward
becoming a <a href='nomad.html'>nomad</a>.</p>

<p>Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity.
Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods
of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place for
an extended period showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school to learn to
play music, moving abroad and incessantly meeting new and different people
improved personal realization.</p>

<p>Learning to solve problems directly produced more sustained periods of output
in comparison to searching for <a href='stack.html'>solutions</a>. Investing in
building hand-crafted <a href='utilities.html'>tools</a> is somewhat equivalent to
learning general-purpose tools, but with a clear advantage of being able to
replicate the tool which is worth its weight in selfstandingness would the tool
suddenly become unavailable.</p>

<p>Optimizing toward the <b>need for less revenue</b> has yielded much better
results than optimizing toward the generation of more. Remaining immobile in
moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, than
acting impulsively and accidentally taking steps away from one's goals.</p>
