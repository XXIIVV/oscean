<h2>We live in a time of social, economic and ecological unravelling. All around us are signs that our way of living is already passing into history.</h2>

<p>Collapse is the transition away from a globalized, hyperconnected and materially-abundant society, toward a state of greater precariousness, lesser abundance, potentially reaching a stage of existential risk for our species. </p>

	those who learn from history are doomed to repeat it with those who didn't
	literacy rates in eighteenth century France were much higher than in the late twentieth century United States
	
	Cut off from the cultural riches of the past we are condemned to live in a narcissistic eternal present. 
	Deprived of the critical tools to question and develop the insights of those who went before us, 
	we are condemned to endlessly repeat and pastiche ourselves, superhero film by superhero film, repetitive pop song by repetitive pop song.

<p>At the peak of the <i>Seneca Cliff</i>, the curve that describes the rapid phase transitions of complex systems on the basis of the principle that "growth is sluggish, but ruin is rapid." We see a green valley in the distance, but the road down the cliff is so steep and rough that it is hard to say whether we will survive the descent. </p>

	<tr>
		<th>Rapid</th>
		<td>Collapse will happen rapidly on a global scale within a narrow timeframe. Local infrastructure failures, political instabilities, or extreme weather events will prevent a gradual transition.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Linear</th>
		<td>Collapse will occur slowly and globally. Global infrastructure and
production chains will be increasingly harder to maintain. Many nation-states
and local communities will see their material conditions deteriorate over the
years. Although this will lead to a reduction in population and welfare, the
gradual transition will allow for <a href='adaptation.html'>adaptation</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Non-Linear</th>
		<td>Due to ecological and infrastructural cross-dependencies, there will be a breaking point where several different and converging forces will be triggered. These will accelerate collapse before a stable situation is reached. This rate of change may be too rapid for humans to adapt to effectively.</td>

<p><b>Creeping normalcy</b> is how gradual changes can be accepted as the normal situation if these changes happen slowly, or incrementally.</p>

<p>The monetary system would not likely collapse in a random fashion but [would]
be triggered when a coalition of corporate and banking interests, both public
and private, determine that they are ready to profit from that
transformation.</p>

<p>The official position of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry was that
frequent consumption of sugary drinks can be a significant factor in the
initiation and progression of dental cavities; that is, it <i>was</i> the
official position before it accepted a million-dollar grant from Coca-Cola.
Rather than recommending reductions in sugar intake, the sugar industry
responded that "attention would be better focused on fluoride toothpaste."</p>

<p>Newer homes and furniture burn faster, giving you less time to escape a fire.
Research shows that 30 years ago, you had about 17 minutes to escape a house
fire. Today it's only 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Rates of myopia have risen sharply in recent decades, and researchers have
projected that half the world will be myopic by 2050. One study by the College
of Optometrists found that myopia is more than twice as common among kids in
the U.K. now than it was the 1960s. </p>

		<td><b>Deniers</b>: there are no downward trends, climatic or ecological threats. The present order is not subject to threats of historic magnitude or capable of experiences compromised material and social well-being. Examples: Koch Brothers, Exxon, Clintel</td>
		<td><b>Defeatists</b>: the collapse is inevitable because we should have acted earlier. Now any technical and political solution is superfluous.</td>

	<tr>
		<td><b>Technological Optimists</b>: collapse is possible, but it is a technical problem that can be solved. In particular, new technologies in the ecological, energetic, and digital field will be able to reverse the phenomena we are observing. </td>
		<td><b>Delayers</b>: collapse is inevitable and the primary goal is to slow it down in order to extend current conditions as much as possible, making it easier to get through the collapse, and to minimize the cost in terms of human lives.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Reformists</b>: collapse will be prevented by deep restructuring of the production system, welfare, and huge investments in ecological remediation. There will be a political tipping point due to the damage caused by the approaching collapse and the resistance of nation-states to act and protect the status quo. When that happens, sufficient forces will be released for radical interventions.</td>
		<td><b>Post-collapsists</b>: the collapse is inevitable and therefore we must act now to build conceptual, technical, and social tools that will serve us during and after the collapse in order to minimize long-term consequences.</td>

	<li><b>Dark Mountaineers</b>: Artists who generally ascribe to the idea that climate collapse cannot be stopped or reversed, a forum in which one can be honest about their sense of dread and loss.</li>

	<li><b>Fossil Capitalism</b>: A theory suggesting the modern economy is actually just a system that runs on fossil fuel.</li>

<p>If green energy investment grows, leading to an increase in total energy production, the price of energy will decrease, which means that large manufacturers will make more of the <a href='commodity.html'>commodities</a> they are producing, rendering their products cheaper in hopes that consumers will buy more of them. Consequently, total energy usage will increase. This applies to energy from all available sources, especially the most established ones—fossil fuels.</p>

Et ces nouveaux dieux ne reculant devant rien<br/>
Étaient prêts à tout pour arriver à leur fins<br/>
Pour s'enrichir encore ils ont rasé la Terre<br/>
Pollué l'air ambiant et tari les rivières<br/>
<br/>
Mais au bout de cent ans des gens se sont levés<br/>
Et les ont averti qu'il fallait tout stopper<br/>
Mais ils n'ont pas compris cette sage prophétie<br/>
Ces hommes là ne parlaient qu'en termes de profits<br/>

<q>Our choicest plans<br />

	stumbled over.
