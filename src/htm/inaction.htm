<ul>
	<li>Establishment of an always perfect tolerance, irrespective of the actions and words of others towards oneself.</li>

<p>What is joy? Joy is the feeling of passing from a lesser to a greater perfection. Joy is the feeling that we are advancing towards happiness. What is happiness? Happiness is the state of the soul that feels itself free of all outside servitudes and feels itself in perfect accord with itself.</p>

<q>Many people are afraid of Emptiness, <br />because it reminds them of

agreeable to our fellow-creatures."</p>
