<h2>Uxntal stacks</h2>

<p>All programming in Unxtal is done by manipulating the <i>working stack</i>,
and <i>return stack</i>. Each stack contains 256 bytes, items from one stack
can be moved into the other. Here are some stack primitives and their effect:
</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th>POP</th><td>a b</td><td>Discard top item.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>NIP</th><td>a c</td><td>Discard second item.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>SWP</th><td>a c b</td><td>Move second item to top.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>ROT</th><td>b c a</td><td>Move third item to top.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>DUP</th><td>a b c c</td><td>Copy top item.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OVR</th><td>a b c b</td><td>Copy second item to top.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A byte is a number between 0-255(256 values), a short is made of two bytes,
each byte in a short can be manipulated individually:</p>

<pre>
#0a #0b POP <span style='float:right'>0a</span>
#12 #3456 NIP <span style='float:right'>12 56</span>
#1234 DUP <span style='float:right'>12 34 34</span>
</pre>

<p>The two stacks are <a

target='_blank'>circular</a>, and so have no depths, to pop an empty stack does
not trigger an error, but merely means to set the stack pointer to 255. There
are no invalid programs, any sequence of bytes is a potential Uxn program. To
learn more about detecting unintended stack effects, see <a
