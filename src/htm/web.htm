<h2>Bitrot: Web apps and Electron.</h2>

<article>
	<p>The goal of porting stuff for the web was originally to escape from X Code
and onto a more portable ecosystem, but the application were much too power
hungry to be usable, the APIs kept changing, browser incompatiblities were hard
to keep up with, and the <a href='https://100r.co/site/story'
target='_blank'>projects were abandoned</a>.</p>
</article>

<p>Subsequent to the iOS development, many applications were migrated to the <a
href='https://www.electronjs.org/' target='_blank'>Electron framework</a> and
web browsers. The entire toolchain, from the necessary internet connection to
access the ever-changing documentation and the energy required for the building
of the massive resulting application, to the bandwidth used for its
publication, was irreconcilable with our studio's solar energy and roaming
connectivity setups.
<p>After a while, I stopped maintaining and using the applications altogether to
preserve energy and bandwidth. As of december 2021, all Electron/HTML5
development was abandoned.</p>
