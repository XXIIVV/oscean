<h2>Sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy.</h2>

<p>Solarpunk is a movement centered on using and being affected by the use of
renewable resources with a focus on decentralization, community activism,
social justice and civic empowerment. A recognition that economic, social, and
ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.</p>

<p>Embracing approachable, <a href='permacomputing.html'>personal technology</a>
and envisioning a world in which the detritus of <a
href='commodity.html'>consumer culture</a> is appropriated and repurposed
toward the reconstruction of a devastated ecology.</p>

<p>Permaculture is the science and practice of creating semi-permanent
ecosystems of nature. The resilience of any such ecosystem is equal to it's
diversity + interconnectedness. Permaculture design is a system of assembling
conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to
benefit life in all its forms. It seeks to provide a sustainable and secure
place for living things on this earth.</p>

<p>Punk is a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It
manifests through <a href='sabotage.html'>direct action</a>, such as protest or
demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades,
squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and
business property destruction.</p>

<p>Solarpunk is also a reaction to the cynical and dystopian imaginaries that
have come out of the fear of climate change. It is a way of tackling
ecoanxieties and an invitation to complement the important work of climate
scientists. Just as climate scientists have sought to warn the world about the
dangers of climate change, Solarpunks are offering alternative visions to the
helplessness often generated by such warnings.</p>

<p>We're destroying the world because we are, in a very literal and deliberate
way, at war with it. People need more than to be made to feel stupid and
guilty. They need more than a vision of <a href='collapse.html'>doom</a>. They
need a vision of the world and of themselves that <b>inspires them</b>.</p>

	<p>Green skills are the abilities needed to develop and support a
resource-efficient society, such as permaculture, food production, food
preservation, ecological construction, maintenance and renovation.</p>

and barefoot tramps, we would not have got beyond the bicycle. That's just it!
we would ride bikes in the cities.</q>
