<h2>Flick is a point-n-click engine.</h2>

<p>Flick is an implementation of Increpare's <a href='https://www.flickgame.org'
target='_blank'>Flickgame</a> designed to work on <a
href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>. The entire idea relies on navigating slides
based on what color is clicked on to create minimal point-n-click adventures
that can easily be shared.</p>

<h3>Manual</h3>

<p>Flick has 4 tools, a <b>pointer</b> that can be used to test the game, a
<b>brush</b> that paints pixels of the selected color, a <b>link brush</b>
which only paints pixels of the link color without touching the base colors,
and a <b>wipe tool</b> which removes the picked color from the scene.</p>

<p>Above the scene previews, below the canvas, are dots that can assign one of
the two link colors on the current scene to point to the slide below. Scenes
can be copied with <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd> and pasted with <kbd>ctrl+v</kbd>. A <a
href='icn_format.html'>1-bit</a> image with the size 28x19 created with <a
href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a> can be pasted <kbd>ctrl+shift+v</kbd>.</p>

<h3>Locks</h3>

<p>This implementation adds the concept of locks, which can disable a link until
a scene has been visited. It's useful for locking events behind certain
actions, for example, waiting for a key to be collected before a door can
open.</p>

<p>The viewer application updates a value that is holding the visited scenes, and
each link color holds the required scenes that need to be visited in order for
that link color to be enabled.</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>

<p>Clicking on the eye icon in the links timeline, toggles between pausing
upon entering the scene, and automatically changing to the next scene after a
delay of 8 ticks at 60fps.</p>

<h3>Flick Format</h3>

<p>The project file is a series of 16 scenes of 16384 bytes each. Each scene is
made of 2-bit canvas data stored as <a href='chr_format.html'>CHR tiles</a>,
followed by 2 bytes holding the scene number for each link color, and 3 bytes for
the RGB values of the scene's links colors.</p>

	Canvas[0x3e80, 0x28 * 0x19 * 0x10]
