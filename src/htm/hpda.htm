<h2>The Hipster PDA is typically notesheets in a binder clip.</h2>

<p>Stacking four <a href='zines.html'>zines</a> in a binder clip gives a quick
DIY notebook with refillable pages. It's a useful <a
href='everyday.html'>everyday carry</a> for folks who don't have a
smartphone.</p>

<p>I cut a Bic ballpoint pen to match the height of the zine(11cm) and carry it
everywhere with me. I use it to write various workout routines, grocery lists,
random things people mention for me to watch or read.</p>
