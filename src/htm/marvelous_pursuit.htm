<h2>The refusal to conceive of human action as divisible.</h2>

<p>Oscar Wilde defines a perfect personality as <i>one who develops under
perfect conditions, who is not wounded, maimed, or in danger</i>. A perfect
personality, then, is only possible in a state of society where one is free to
choose the mode of <a href='work.html'>work</a>, the conditions of work, and the freedom to work. One
to whom the making of a table, the building of a house, or the tilling of the
soil, is what the painting is to the artist and the discovery to the scientist
&mdash; the result of inspiration, of intense longing, and deep interest in
work as a creative force. </p>

<p>People need not only to obtain things, they need above all the freedom to
make things among which they can live, to give shape to them according to their
own tastes, and to put them to use in caring for and about others.</p>

<p>The marvelous pursuit is born from the desire to create playful complexity in
a desert of simplistic convenience. A hobby is a form of consumption, the
marvelous pursuit on the other hand, is a rejection of <a
href='commodity.html'>commodified convenience</a>, it can't be bought because
it has no price. A marvelous pursuit refuses socially ascribed use. People
learn such socially useless things as the names of fern and the grammar of dead
languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to
them on TV.</p>

<p>Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment
because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by
ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces.</p>

<p>These pursuits often create complexity but a complexity which is opposed to
that of the technician. The <i>master</i> of a marvelous pursuit can never be
an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society, and
therefore to capital.</p>

<p>Hobbies are forms of <a href='simulacra.html'>alienated leisure</a>,
compartmentalized parts of one's life, past-times whose purpose is to fill our
time with countable accomplishments and enjoyments. The value in marvelous
pursuits lies in their self-creation which evades both use-value and exchange
value.</p>

<p>Since the riches of information, entertainment, games and new electronics will
fail to center and illuminate our lives, however, their diversion will more and
more lead to distraction, the scattering of our attention and the atrophy of
our capacities. They will be more diverting due to greater variety and closer
fit with our individual tastes. It is already apparent that the new video
technology is not used by people as the crucial aid that finally allows them to
develop into the historians, critics, musicians, sculptors, or athletes that
they have always wanted to be.</p>

<h3>Divided Labor</h3>

<p>Divided labor must be distinguished from the specialization of work which is
as old as human culture and practiced in the very pretechnological work world
that some of us admire. Nor is the division of a work process into steps and
the frequent repetition of just one step characteristic of modern industrial
labor.</p>

<p>A tinsmith who is about to make a great number of funnels would not
complete one after another, each from start to finish, but would first do all
the drawing on sheet metal, then all the cutting, and so on, and would make
specialized devices which the economy of scale would permit and reward. The
typically modern division of labor, on the other hand, divides one process into
many simple parts and assigns the performance of each to a single worker. The
monotonous and endless repetition of one small task is typical of much of
modern labor and gives it its stupefying and draining character.</p>

<p>Divided labor favors dexterity only if we understand by the latter the
ability to execute a simple motion quickly and reliably. If by dexterity we
mean the manifold and trained ability of bodily timing, strength, and
responsiveness, then the division of labor is the elimination of dexterity. The
division of labor makes work more reliable because the simplicity of divided
labor eliminates the need of skill, thus enlarging the labor pool and making
workers more freely substitutable for one another.</p>

<q>Through a practice we are able to accomplish what remains unattainable when
aimed at in a series of individual decisions and acts.</q>
