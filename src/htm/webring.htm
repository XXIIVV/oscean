<h2>Webring like we're in 2000!</h2>

<p>The <b>webring</b> is a directory of neighbor websites and portfolios.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to <b>inspire artists and developers to create and maintain their own personal website</b>, and share traffic organically among each other. The ring's aim is to promote the creation of hand crafted diaries, wikis, bookmarks and portfolios.</p>
<p>You can view the full directory <a href='https://webring.xxiivv.com' target='_blank'>here</a>, or more info on how to join the network <a href='https://github.com/XXIIVV/webring' target='_blank'>here</a>. Many of the webring participants were members who helped with the development of the P2P social network <a href='rotonde.html'>Rotonde</a>.</p>
<q>The internet is a utility world for me now. It is efficient and all-encompassing. It is not very much fun.</q>

<p>Apparently, someone in the 1950s also came up with the icon we use for the
webring by <a href='http://www.logobook.com/logo/offset-druck-lausanne'
target='_blank'>rotating the number 6</a> three times. It's a coincidence, the
webring logo was meant to be a three way roundabout to indicate that the
members of the ring share traffic with each other.</p>
