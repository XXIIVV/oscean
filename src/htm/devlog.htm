<h2>The devlog is a collection of design notes.</h2>

<p>Below are disjointed thoughts on the creation of a <i>clean-slate computing
stack</i> based on the <a href='permacomputing.html'>universal virtual
machine</a> strategy for digital preservation of software projects and
documentation for <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a>. The
content of the devlog was presented in front of an audience during <a
href='https://100r.co/site/weathering_software_winter.html'
target='_blank'>Weathering Software Winter</a>.</p>

<p>The realization of this project is largely due to the work of the community,
with special thanks to Andy Alderwick, Sigrid Solveig Haflínudóttir, Andrew
Richards, and everyone else who contributed ideas and shared their knowledge
with me, without which Uxn could not have become what it is now. Nearly a year
after its initial draft, <a
href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>a lot of
uxn code</a> has been written. In fact, both the <a
href='left.html'>text-editor</a> used to write the devlog and the <a
href='about.html'>wiki</a> that generated this page, are hosted on this strange
personal computer.</p>
