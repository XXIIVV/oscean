<h2>Thousand Rooms is a visual novel.</h2>

<p><a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a> was created in collaboration
with illustrator <a href='rekka.html'>Rekka Bellum</a>, documenting the short
vignettes of Bat, Cat, Owl and Fox. We have written this book with the hopes of
creating a sort of <i>Borges for children</i>, in which the reader follows four
characters who try and make sense of their <i>small world</i>.</p>

avenues. We are releasing the book in <a href='english.html'>English</a>, French, <a
