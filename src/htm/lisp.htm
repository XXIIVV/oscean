<h2>A common trait of all dialects of LISP is the S-expression.</h2>

<p>In Lisp, a pair of parentheses indicates one step of calculation, operations
use the <a href='notation.html'>prefix notation</a>. </p>

<p>Programs in Lisp are made of symbols that are nested into trees using cons cells. A <b>number</b> is a signed integer represented by a sequence of decimal
digits, optionally preceded by a sign. </p>

<pre>
45
+137
-27</pre>

<p>A <b>symbol</b> is word represented by a sequence of characters, it cannot begin
with a number or a sign, although these may appear later in a symbol. </p>

<pre>
Hello
Hello-world
x32 </pre>

<p>A <b>cons cell</b> is an allocation of memory made of two parts, a value(car) and a pointer(cdr), the cdr can point to another cell.</p>

<pre>
(123)
(hello 45)
(foo (bar baz))
</pre>
