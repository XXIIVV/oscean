<h2>Risan Aldeth is one of the coastal region bordering Yajnev.</h2>

<p>The shore is cut off by the <a href='yajnev.html'>Yajnev storm</a>, compressing incoming weather around the tempest and building up to hurricanes of cataclysmic intensity. Almost nothing remains of the old constructions but a handful of <a href='soies_injection.html'>synthetic structures</a> unaffected by the wind.</p>

<p>The region was surveyed and cataloged by <a href='ver_iytsl.html'>Iytsl</a> of the <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Aitaslan Hermetists</a>, leaving behind a journal that advised <a href='neonev.html'>Neonev</a>'s travels.</p>
