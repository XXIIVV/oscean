<p>We use software because we have goals to achieve and things to do. The
software we use is coded by programmers who have their own goals, sometimes
these goals overlap with ours, over time these will diverge. The tools we
depend on grow features we don't use or understand, introducing bugs that will
prevent us from reaching our goals.</p>

<p>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it, we have the
choice of trying another program, and we have the choice of coding the software
ourselves. All but the last path mean <a href='stack.html'>endless seeking</a>,
evaluating and further deviation from our goals. </p>

<ul>
	<li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li>
	<li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
	<li>We learn how the tools we depend on need to work.</li>
	<li>We gain a deep understanding of our problem domain.</li>
	<li>We embrace sharing of ideas and code.</li>
</ul>

box for the Sony Playstation. There, on the screen, against a single-color
background, was a <b>black triangle</b>. <a

<q>Programming is a form of worldmaking, in which the coder defines how that
world operates.<a href='https://www.chronicle.com/article/hello-worlds/'
