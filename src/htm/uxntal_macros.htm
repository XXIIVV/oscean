<h2>Uxntal Macros</h2>

<p>A macro is a way of defining inline routines, it allows to create new words that will be replaced by the body of the macro, as opposed to a jump where the program counter will move to a routine and back, therefore it needs to be defined before its usage, as follow: </p>

<pre>
%modulo ( num denum -- res ) {
	DIVk MUL SUB
}

@routine ( -- c* )
	#18 #03 modulo
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>In the previous example, the token <kbd>modulo</kbd> will get replaced by the body of the macro during assembly:</p>

<pre>
@routine ( -- c* )
	#18 #03 DIVk MUL SUB
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> A macro does not have a <a href='uxntal_labels.html#scope'>scope</a>, so it may not contain sublabels if the macro is to be used multiple time within a single parent label, <a href='uxntal_lambdas.html'>lambdas</a> are immune to this limitation.</p>
