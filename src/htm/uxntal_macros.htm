<h2>Uxntal Macros</h2>

<p>A macro is a way of defining inline routines, it allows to create new words
that will be replaced by the body of the macro, as opposed to a jump where the
program counter will move to a routine and back, therefore it needs to be
defined before its usage, as follow: </p>

<pre>
%modulo ( num denum -- res ) {
	DIVk MUL SUB }

@routine ( -- c* )
	#18 #03 modulo JMP2r
</pre>

<p>In the previous example, the token <kbd>modulo</kbd> will get replaced by the
body of the macro during assembly:</p>

<pre>
@routine ( -- c* )
	#18 #03 DIVk MUL SUB JMP2r
</pre>
