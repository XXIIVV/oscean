<p>The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when
carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel. The
human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into <b>amino
acids</b> and used throughout its systems.</p>

<p>The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino
acids â€” permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes
sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized,
the <b>Essential Amino Acids</b>.</p>

<p>To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs have access to the full
sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is
missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or
sugars.</p>

<p>Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a
complete protein(see <i>Limiting Amino Acids</i>) are oats, garbanzo beans,
sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin
seeds. There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard,
broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.</p>

<q>There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic
as <a href='nutrition.html'>nutrition</a></q>

<p>Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct
ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and
repair.</p>

<p>The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is <b>Beans with grains, nuts or seeds</b>. Eat .7 to 1g of protein per lb of body-weight to maintain muscle mass.</p>
