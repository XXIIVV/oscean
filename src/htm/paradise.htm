<h2>Paradise is an interactive-fiction playground.</h2>

<p>In Paradise, the world is a sea of nodes, each with a single parent and any number of children. A user is a force acting upon the world through a <i>became vessel</i>. There are no division between "users", "files" and "applications", everything is a <b>vessel</b>.</p>

<p>A <i>vessel</i> is an object that can act onto other objects, possibly carrying objects, with its own permissions. The <b>lobby</b> begins with a <code>ghost</code> created by itself inside a <code>library</code> created by itself, within itself. Upon creation, the ghost is the default user vessel. Vessels may be within themselves, or even organized in the shape of a loop.</p>

<p>Pockets of space can be hosts to vessels existing around a common purpose, or carried around inside another vessel as you would a tool-belt or an inventory, giving the acting vessel, or <i>user</i>, additional actions appended to the list of primitives.</p>

<pre>
You are a ghost in a teapot.
The inside of the teapot is stormy.

You see a cat.
You carry a haunted house.</pre>

<p>The interface shows who is where, a note about the parent vessel when there is one, what is seen and what is carried.</p>
