<h2>Remixing the Banjo Brothers Commuter Bag</h2>

<p>I've used one of these fantastic canvas commuter bags from Banjo Brothers for over 15 years, but having finally worn it out to the point where the canvas was so brittle that you could poke holes with your index finger, I didn't have the heart to throw it away after so many years of faithful service.</p>

<p>So, I cut all the seams off, spread it all out, traced each part on fresh 14oz canvas and tried my best to make a new one. I've taken the opportunity to improve some things.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Instead of a canvas support connecting the backpack straps to the back panel, I ran webbing all the way across the back panel and used stainless d-rings for the connection.</li>
	<li>I changed the design of the cover panel so that instead of a strap segment running from under the panel to the front, I ran an old life-vest belt buckle around the whole bag. I believe that the belt is weight tested for 500kg, I might trust that backpack to stay whole hanging hang it for dear life.</li>
	<li>I've also added 4 layers of canvas for the bottom panel and re-enforced the liner, at the cost of impermeability, where it was previous heat welded.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've reused the zipper/pocket segment of the front panel as it was mostly fine, the shoulder straps, recycled the mesh fabric of the back panel but had to replace the liner and I've also reused the little umbrella patch that was on the cover panel because it looks so nice.</p>

<p>I bought 10$ of canvas, 4$ of d-rings, 2$ of webbing and spent roughly 30 hours on it. I certainly hope that it may last for another 15 years.</p>

	<p>This is my love-letter to the excellent work of Banjo Brothers, I sincerely this is not offending the original creators in any way. I am not sponsored by Banjo Brothers, and I am not selling this custom bag.</p>
