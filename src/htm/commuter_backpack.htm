<h2>Remixing the Banjo Brothers Commuter Bag</h2>

<p>I've used one of these fantastic canvas commuter bags from Banjo Brothers for over 15 years, but having finally worn it out to the point where the canvas was so brittle that you could poke holes with your index finger, I didn't have the heart to throw it away after so many years of faithful service.</p>

<p>So, I cut all the seams off, spread it all out, traced each part on fresh 14oz canvas and tried my best to make a new one. I've taken the opportunity to improve some things.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Instead of a canvas connection connecting the backpack straps to the back panel, I ran webbing all the way across the back panel and used stainless d-rings for connection.</li>
	<li>I changed the design of the front panel so that instead of a strap segment running from under the panel to the front, I ran an old life-vest belt buckle around the whole bag. I believe that the belt is weight tested for 500kg, I might trust that backpack to stay whole hanging from it over a cliff.</li>
	<li>I've also added 4 layers of canvas for the bottom panel.</li>
</ul>

	<p>This is my love-letter to the excellent work of Banjo Brothers, I sincerely this is not offending in any way.</p>

<p>I certainly hope that it may last for another 15 years.</p>
