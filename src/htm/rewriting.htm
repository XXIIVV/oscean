<h2>String rewriting languages are usually a series of rules that transform strings in a given alphabet.</h2>

<p>A string rewriting system is based on an alphabet which is just a set of symbols. Strings over a given alphabet are arbitrary sequences of symbols, each taken from the alphabet. The empty sequence or null string is included. A string rewriting system consists of an alphabet and a relation <kbd>-></kbd>, a set of such pairs or rules.</p>

<pre>swap x y -> y x</pre>

<p>These languages have multiple, distinct phases with different syntactic and semantic rules. There are often two phases; the first gives a set of rules, and the second provides objects on which those rules are to be applied.</p>

<pre>swap foo bar <i>; bar foo</i></pre>
