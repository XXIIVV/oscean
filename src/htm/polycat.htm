<h2>Polycat is a tough little platformer game.</h2>

<p>Jump around a grey world populated with hard to reach platforms and a few
birds that will lend you a hand. There are always birds in our games for some
reason. This project was made in collaboration with <a
href='https://kokorobot.ca' target='_blank'>Rek</a> who did all the pretty
assets and animations, locations in the world are written in <a
href='roudo_ses.html'>Roudo Ses</a>.</p>
