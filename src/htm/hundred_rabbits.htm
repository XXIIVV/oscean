<h2>Technological resilience research, aboard a sailboat.</h2>

<p>Hundred Rabbits is a collective exploring the planned failability of <a
href='technology.html'>modern technology</a> at the bounds of the
hyper-connected world. We explore <a href='permacomputing.html'>low-tech
solutions</a> and document our findings with the hope of building a more
resilient future.</p>

<p>We live and work on a 10 meters vessel called <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>,
we have sailed around the Pacific Ocean and realized how fragile the modern-day
<a href='stack.html'>computing stack</a> was. Living in remote uninhabited
parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades
beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

<p>This partnership is host to creative interactive projects like <a
href='https://rabbitwaves.ca' target='_blank'>RabbitWaves</a>, <a
href='grimgrains.html'>Grimgrains</a>, <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> and <a
href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>.</p>

<p>The name <i>Hundred Rabbits</i> comes from the name of the sailboat in the
animated show <a
href='https://ergoproxy.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Calm_(Busy_Doing_Nothing)'
target='_blank'>Ergo proxy</a>, while the sailboat's name Pino</i> comes from
the android sailor aboard the sailboat from that same show.</p>
