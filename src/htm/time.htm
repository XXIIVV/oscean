<h2>A place that no mortal can ever reach.</h2>

<p>Every day shift is followed by a night shift, and every night shift by a day
shift, so neither will ever get the final word. The real course of immutable
history which we all share, then, must be the limit of an infinite number of
changes. The history that we all share is the final word once all the work has
been done.</p>

<p>Since there will always have been a finite number of human generations
following the construction of the first time machine, and since the men of each
generation will only work a finite number of shifts during their lives, humans
will never be able to write the last of an infinite number of changes. If the
last word cannot be had by any mortal, then it must be had by some supernatural
entity. It is the thesis of the present interpretation that the final course of
history is determined by the will of God. <a

<h3>spacetime</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Entropy</b>: Or Irreversibility, a lack of order or predictability, gradual decline into disorder.</li>
	<li><b>False Vacuum</b>: An hypothetical vacuum(space devoid of matter) that is not entirely stable. If a small region of the universe reached a more stable vacuum, this change would spread.</li>
	<li><b>Great Filter</b>: With no evidence of intelligent life other than ourselves, it appears that the process of starting with a star and ending with "advanced explosive lasting life" must be unlikely.</li>
	<li><b>Von Neumann probes</b>: Or Universal Assemblers, A spacecraft capable of replicating itself.</li>
	<li><b>Final anthropic principle</b>: Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, will never die out.</li>
	<li><b>Mathematical universe hypothesis</b>: Or Tegmark Universe, our external physical reality is a mathematical structure consisting of starting conditions with rules about how they are to evolve. Any universe that corresponds to a logically coherent mathematical object exists, but universes exist “more”(in some sense) in proportion to their underlying mathematical simplicity.</li>
	<li><b>Liminality</b>: The quality of ambiguity, or disorientation, that occurs during a middle stage, or a threshold. Liminal places can range from borders and frontiers to crossroads and airports, which people pass through but do not live in.</li>
	<li><b>Causality</b>: Relationship between a cause and an effect, where the effect is a direct consequence of the cause.</li>
	<li><b>Eternal Return</b>: A theory that the universe and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form an infinite number of times across infinite time or space.</li>
	<li><b>Super now</b>: A type of prediction taking things that are happening now and imagining that the future will be just like now, only “more extreme.”</li>
	<li><b>Teleology</b>: The study of things that happen for the sake of their future consequences. The fallacious meaning of it is that events are the result of future events.</li>
	<li><b>Prediction</b>: Statement or claim that a particular event will occur in the future in more certain terms than a forecast.</li>

<q>When you tire of living, change itself seems evil, does it not? for then any
change at all disturbs the deathlike peace of the life-weary.</q>
