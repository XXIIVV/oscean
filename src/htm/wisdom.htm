<h2>A collection of notes on Wisdom.</h2>

<p>The end of the cycle is that of the independent, clear-minded, all-seeing Child. That is the level known as <b>wisdom</b>.</p>
<p>To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of <b>simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust</b>.</p>

<q>There are two wisdoms: the first inclines to <a href='action.html'>action</a>, the second to <a href='inaction.html'>inaction</a>.</q>

<h3>Gurdjieff's self-remembering</h3>

<p>Put simply, one is to remember themselves as much as possible. A portion of your conscious action should be of being conscious of being conscious of being. Self-remembering and being-present are not the same, though abstractly they serve the same purpose. When one becomes overly emotional, overly attached, or identified with some idea of brand to the extent of a personal automatism, they have lost their self - they have forgotten themselves.</p>

<p>When the Hyperpresent begins to attend to your reality, begins to barrage you with the minute and incessant comings-and-goings of modernity, do not let your self be pulled by that which you never asked for in the first place. Remember to self-remember. Remember yourself, focus on being. Whether or not there is an emotion, a thought, a presence, an analysis, there is still something observing, and that which is observing you should turn your attention towards.</p>
