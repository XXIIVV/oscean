<h2>Beautiful architecture, beautiful architecture everywhere.</h2>

<p>I first visited Austria when I was invited to give a <a href='talk.html'>talk</a> about the future of internet curation for <i>Ars Electronica</i> in September of 2015. I returned in November of 2025 to present a <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> workshop and keynote at <i>Ultramateria</i> in the Collini Areal building in Hohenems.</p>
