<h2>Open computation that goes beyond open source, made from parts designed to
be recombined.</h2>

<p>Every layer of a malleable computing system is designed to support arbitrary
recombination, reused across environments and freely sharable with
others. Modifying such a system happens in the context of use, rather than
through some separate tool and skill set.</p>

<p>In contrast with monolithic applications, these amorphous computers are
finely tuned and thoughtfully crafted by their operator over the course of a
practice.</p>

<p>At its core, a malleable system is made of heterogeneous parts capable of
assemblage. Within the context of computation, it is an attribute shared by
different interoperable systems, not unlike programs that communicate via <a
href='unix.html#pipes'>unix pipes</a>, file browsers and some flow-based
programming environments.</p>

</center>

<p>A malleable part is a transformer in a chain of transformers, and is itself
also made of equally interconnected links, nodes or agents. The more malleable
a system, the blurrier the distinction in the granularity of these parts.</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr><th colspan="4" style="text-align:center">Malleability</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:black;color:white">Silo</td>
		<td>A system in which nodes will forcefully captures the message is a <b>silo</b>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#a0ffa0;color:black">Shallow</td>
		<td>Messages can enter and leave a system that is not malleable itself,
this is malleability of a superficial kind.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#4fdd9a;color:black">Average</td>
		<td>Messages can flow freely between internal nodes of a malleable system, but
capabilities are restricted by domain, interface, or operator competency.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background:#47c199;color:black">Deep</td>
		<td>Messages can be passed seamlessly across every level of the system, the
division into <i>layers</i> has entirely vanished.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>A potential advantage to this granularity is the distribution of complexity so
that an operator can more gently transition toward a deeper understanding of
the finer parts that makes up the solution to a problem.</p>

<p><b>Designing for reversibility</b> is to make a system
approachable to a wide range of competency, lower the cost of errors, and
limit the blame put upon its operator, by favoring transformations that can be
undone.</p>

<p>Some automata conserve enough state through their transformation that
computation can happen backward, without cluttering large amount of memory with
<i>screenshots</i>.</p>

</center>

<p>Familiar examples of reversible computation are the multiplication of a number
by a <a href='fractions.html'>fraction</a> and using the reciprocal to recover
that number, or the stack machine operation <i>rot</i>. The bitwise operator
<i>not</i> or the stack machine <i>swap</i> are <a
href='reversible_computing.html'>involutive</a>, which means that
same operator can applied once again to recover the earlier state.</p>

<p><b>Designing for concatenation</b> is using a point-free message passing
paradigm that does not identify the arguments on which it operates. It is
mentioned here as it might prove valuable in a <i>Deeply Malleable</i> system
as a way to combined both inspectability down to its the mechanical
transformation, and reasonable evaluation performance.</p>

<pre>
: SQUARED ( n -- n^2 ) DUP * ;
: CUBED ( n -- n^3 ) DUP SQUARED * ;
</pre>

<p>In such a system, nodes merely compose other nodes, among which are
combinators that manipulate the arguments, <i>regardless of context</i>. This is
a fancy way of saying that a concatenative sub-expression can be replaced with a
<b>name</b> that represents that same sub-expression.</p>

<pre>
: POPCNT ( n -- bits ) 0 swap
BEGIN dup WHILE tuck 1 AND + swap 1 rshift REPEAT
DROP ;
</pre>

<p>A maximally accessible system such that the finer details in movement of bits
are observable but that does not run on generic hardware would be paradoxical by
virtue of its inaccessibility. For that reason, depending on the host computer,
a function definition like the one above(which might exist as a single opcode),
should probably still be part of the observable system definitions even if it
is not evaluated.</p>

<p><b>Designing for differences</b> is to consider the compatibility between
wildly different interfaces and notations to support networks of people
collaborating, across many levels of competency, to make software work for
themselves and their communities.</p>

<p>The rewriting language <a
href='https://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/maude1/manual/maude-manual-html/maude-manual_31.html'
target='_blank'>Maude</a>, uses a <i>mixfix notation</i>, making the system
neither prefix, infix, or postfix, but adaptable to the user's needs and
background. To demonstrate something akin to the mixfix notation and give a
taste of rewriting, consider a <a href='modal.html'>system made of rules</a> where a given <i>left-hand
side</i> is replaced by its corresponding <i>right-hand side</i>, and where
<code>?words</code> will match anything.</p>

<pre>
(add ?x ?y) -> (?x + ?y)
(?x ?y add) -> (?x + ?y)

((?a) + ?b) -> (?a + (?b))
(0 + ?b) -> (sum ?b)
</pre>
<pre style='margin-top:-29px'>
(add 1 2)
</pre>

<img

	style='float:right; margin-left:30px; width:100px'/>

<p>The first two rules of the program above both enable the translation between
prefix & postfix, to the infix notation, as well as transcribing the english
symbol <code>add</code> that could otherwise be localized. This is to demonstrate that inter op between
vastly different systems is possible.</p>

<p><b>Designing for bootstrapping</b> is to make a system which does not depend on a binary seed that
cannot be built from source. The goal is to start from a
minimal, easily inspectable binary which should be readable as
source and bootstrap into a practical and reproducible user interface. A build is <i>reproducible</i> if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit identical copies of all specified artifacts. To accomplish this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The build system needs to be made entirely deterministic. Transforming a given source must always create the same result. For example, the current date and time must not be recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.</li>
	<li>The set of tools used to perform the build and more generally the build environment should either be recorded or pre-defined.</li>
	<li>Users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build environment, perform the build process, and validate that the output matches the original build.</li>
</ul>
