<h2>Imagining open computation that goes beyond open source, made from parts designed to be recombined.</h2>

<p>Every layer of a malleable computing system is designed to support arbitrary recombination, reuse across environments and must be freely sharable with others. Modifying a system should happen in the context of use, rather than through some separate toolchain or skill set. People of all experience levels must be able to retain ownership and control.</p>

<h3>Units of Computation</h3>

<p>At its core, a malleable system is made of non-homogeneous nodes capable of exchanging information with each other. It is an attribute shared by different interoperable systems catering to each individual's needs. Generally speaking, a malleable program is part of a chain, and is itself also made of smaller interconnected links. </p>

<pre>
input -> transformation -> output.
11010 .. 00101..
</pre>

<p>A node in a graph that captures the input is called a <b>silo</b>, and is therefore not malleable.</p>

<table border='1' style='float:right; margin-left:30px'>
	<tr><th colspan='2'>Even Check</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Message</th><th>Bit</th></tr>
	<tr style='font-family:mono'><td>1101 001</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Design for decay</b>: A message, as far as computers are concerned, is an anonymous stream of bits in transit. Error correction is done by transmitting additional information to catch information loss or tampering. For example, by adding a <i>parity bit</i> that corresponds to the odd or even number of active bits in a specific length of data.</p>

<p>A <i>decay hardened quine</i> refers to a programming concept where a quine program, a program that prints its own source code, is designed to be robust against character corruption or "decay."</p>

<p>For a message to be interoperable, it should include enough information for the receiver to know how to use the information, but not too much as to clutter the signal.</p>

<pre>
0010100100100101 (header length: data:)
</pre>

<p><b>Design for diversity</b>: Some rewriting languages, like <a href='https://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/maude1/manual/maude-manual-html/maude-manual_31.html' target='_blank'>Maude</a>, uses a mixfix notation making the system neither prefix, infix, or postfix, but adaptable to the user's needs and situation.</p>

<p>Interfacing with the physical world, by scanning to bring a picture in the chain, and printing to get it out.</p>

<p>Computing should be a thoughtfully crafted, fun, and empowering experience.</p>
