<h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from
permaculture.</h2>

<p>Permacomputing encourages the maximization of hardware lifespan, minimization
of energy usage and focuses on the use of already available computational
resources. It values maintenance and refactoring of systems to keep them
efficient, instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>,
permacomputing practices <a href='salvage_computing.html'>planned
longevity</a>. It is about using computation only when it has a strengthening
effect on ecosystems.</p>

<p id='disassembly'><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of
a product can be disassembled for repair and for <i>end
of life</i>. This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a
product's life cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken
apart at the end of its life so that each component can be reclaimed. </p>

<q>That which cannot be repaired is already broken.</q>

<p>This means using simple mechanical fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling
components with their material type, and ensuring components can be
disassembled with everyday tools. Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a
<i>sustainable</i> product, designing a product for disassembly is a more
concrete, quantifiable approach to ecologically sound making and to
consumption. </p>

<h3>Articulating the Value of Absence</h3>

<p>There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs,
advised by the concepts of permacomputing, and personalized systems to address
those needs, but there are no permacomputing products. Permacomputing is
concerned about finding these limits, and <b>not their artifacts</b>.</p>

/>
<p>Computation is intrinsically <b>self-obviating</b>, which is to mean that the
computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less necessary
to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to provide for
their own welfare.</p>
