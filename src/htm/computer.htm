<h2>Workstations over the years.</h2>

<p>I tend to choose setups for audio-visual creation. When living at anchor,
power is soemtimes a critical resource aboard <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>,
especially on grey days, I'll prefer to work on a Pi, otherwise my main
workstation is going to be the Thinkpad.</p>

<p>Most of the tools I use work within a <a href='varvara.html'>portable
virtual-machine</a>, each software is written in <a
href='uxntal.html'>assembly</a> and fits within 64kb of space. Making my
toolkit mostly disconected from the underlying host operating system. I
occasionally use an emulated <a href='macintosh.html'>Macintosh</a> for <a
href='pascal.html'>Pascal</a> projects.</p>

<p>I presently run the community version of <a
href='https://manjaro.org/download/#i3' target='_blank'>Manjaro</a>(i3), the
laptop was donated to <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a> by <a
href='https://twitter.com/thisismyclone' target='_blank'>Josh Auget</a>.</p>

<p>Usagi is a <a href='raspberry.html'>Raspberry Pi 3B+</a>, with the <i>Pi
Foundation</i> 7" ribbon cable monitor(800x480), running the <a
href='plan9.html'>Plan9</a> operating system. Connected to the computer is a <a
href='keyboard.html'>mechanical keyboard</a>, and a Lenovo 3 buttons mouse.
This is the ideal solar workstation aboard <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> as it
takes very little power, and the operating system comes with a complete suite
of well-documented tools and is independant from the whims of packages and
dependencies.</p>
