<h2>Technical details on my computer setups.</h2>

<p>The following setups are geared toward audio & visual production and research. When
living at anchor, power is a critical resource aboard <a
href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, I prefer to work on a low-power SBC like <a
href='usagi.html'>Usagi</a> otherwise my main workstation is <a
href='ayatori.html'>Ayatori</a>.</p>

<p>The tools I use exists within a <a href='varvara.html'>portable
virtual-machine</a>, each software is written in <a
href='uxntal.html'>assembly</a> and fits within 64kb of space. To see the full
list of applications, see <a href='roms.html'>roms</a>. </p>

<p>I also occasionally use an emulated <a href='macintosh.html'>Macintosh</a>
for various <a href='pascal.html'>Pascal</a> projects. To learn more about the
audio equipment, see the <a href='studio.html'>studio</a>.</p>
