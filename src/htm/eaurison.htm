<h2>The southern shoreline of Dilitriel</h2>

<p>The Eaurison coast extends into the <a href='kanikule.html'>Kanikule distortion</a>. It is a place famous for having an <a href='the_sixth_season.html'>extra season</a>, and in some places nearest to the edge of the distortion, one must walk around any one point in space for one and half turn to complete a full orbit, making the place extremely dangerous but equally valuable to <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Soies research</a>.</p>

<p>The corridor between <a href='laeisth.html'>Laeisth</a> and <a href='dilitriel.htlm'>Dilitriel</a> is best crossed by glider since the terrain is dotted with chasms.</p>
