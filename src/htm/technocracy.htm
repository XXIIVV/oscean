<p>Science is hated because its mastery requires too much hard work, and, by the
same token, its practitioners, the scientists, are hated because of their power
they derive from it.<a

<p><b>The end of work</b> is the upcoming abstraction and machine automation of
mostly all that is currently understood as work. Inside capitalism, the
critical moment is specifically where technology meets capital: who gets to own
this <i>capital</i>; the "factory without the worker".</p>

<p>The end of work, or <i>the end of jobs</i>, is an immediate <a
href='collapse.html'>reality</a>. For most, who are currently subsisting
through participation in the wage labour system, this is also end of getting
paid and able to "not die". The idea that <i>for every job at the bottom closed
by technology, there's one opening at the top</i> is ridiculous.</p>

<q>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country, dividing
logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a precise
fraction of the state's profit.</q>

<p>The state did not appreciate the journeymen's associations' tendency to <a
href='sabotage.html'>strike</a>, nor their ability to move as they pleased when
work conditions were unfavorable. The state's response was to take over the
management of the construction sites, merging all the divisions of labor
together in the supreme distinction between the intellectual and the manual,
the theoretical and the practical.</p>

<p>By separating intellectual and physical labor the state took power away from
both types of workers. The manual laborers could then only build what others
had planned and the planners no longer had the capacity to build anything at
all.</p>

<h3>Manufacturing Scarcity</h3>

<p>People have a native capacity for healing, consoling, moving, learning,
building their houses, and burying their dead. Each of these capacities meets a
need. The means for the satisfaction of these needs are abundant so long as
they depend primarily on what people can do for themselves, with only marginal
dependence on commodities.</p>

<p>These basic satisfactions become scarce when the social environment is
transformed in such a manner that basic needs can no longer be met by abundant
competence. The establishment of radical monopoly happens when people give up
their native ability to do what they can do for themselves and for each other,
in exchange for something "better" that can be done for them only by a major
tool.</p>

<q>Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would
set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave
them.</q>

<p>Lauderdale pointed out that the only way to increase <i>private riches</i>
was to reduce what he called <i>public wealth</i>, or the commons. To enclose
things that were once free so that people have to pay in order to access them.
To illustrate, he noted that colonialists would often even burn down trees that
produced nuts and fruits so that local inhabitants wouldn't be able to live off
of the natural abundance of the earth, but would be forced to work for wages in
order to feed themselves.</p>

<p>As a first step, new standards were set for the construction of dwelling
units. These standards were intended to protect the person who purchases a
house, from exploitation by the industry producing it. Paradoxically, these
same standards deprived many more people of the traditional opportunity to
house themselves.</p>

<p>Preservation of the sick life of medically dependent people in an unhealthy
environment became the principal business of the medical profession. Natural
immunity, and traditional culture could not cope. On a world-wide scale,
medical care concentrated on breeding a human stock that was fit only for
domesticated life within an increasingly more costly, man-made, scientifically
controlled environment. </p>

<p>Hospital-born, formula-fed, antibiotic-stuffed children thus grow into adults
who can breathe the air, eat the food, and survive the lifelessness of a modern
city, who will breed and raise at almost any cost a generation even more
dependent on medicine.</p>

<p>Rates of myopia have risen sharply in recent decades, and researchers have
projected that half the world will be myopic by 2050. One study by the College
of Optometrists found that myopia is more than twice as common among kids in
the U.K. now than it was the 1960s. </p>
