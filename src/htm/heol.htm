<p>Evaluation is done by scanning from left-to-right across a string that represents a serialized tree. Rules are tested against each node, when a match occurs, the left-hand side of the matching pattern is erased from the tree, the right-hand side of the rule is written in its stead, and scanning starts over at the start of the tree. The evaluation ends when no rule match.</p>
