	<h2>2026-01-06 Hey</h2>
	<p>Back in 2006, when the <a href='identity.html'>XXIIVV logo</a> was created, web 2.0 aesthetics were in full swing, outer glows and shiny vertical gradients were everywhere. As a reaction to that trend, I tried to design it as stark as possible, without decoration and without texture. The goal was for it to be representable using only a handful of Bézier control points which aligned with my style at the time.</p>
	<p>In 2026, the era of gradients and extrusion blendings has long passed, minimalism reigns supreme, logos are reduced to simple black shapes with not a single line that couldn't be justified to a board-meeting. So, I felt the urge to move away from all that, and get something closer to the works I do today, and at the same time, find a way to express my love for cursive and analog practices.</p>
	<p>In other words, the change was to go from a logo that can be written in a single stroke by a computer, to one that can be written in a single stroke by a person.</p>
