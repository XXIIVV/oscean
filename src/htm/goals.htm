<p>I am a citizen of the most beautiful nation on earth. A nation whose laws are
harsh yet simple, a nation that never cheats, which is immense and without
borders, where life is lived in the present. In this limitless nation, this
nation of wind, light, and peace, there is no other ruler besides the sea.</p>
