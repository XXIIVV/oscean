<h2>Technology is the active human interface with the material world.</h2>

<p>Suppose one were to write a revolutionary book. If it is to be published, it
must enter into the framework of the technical organization of book publishing.
It must appeal to some public and hence must refrain from attacking the real
taboos of the public for which it is destined. No one will publish a book
attacking the real religion of our times, by which I mean the dominant social
forces of the <a href='technocracy.html'>technological society</a>.</p>

<h3>Surrogate Activities</h3>

<p>We indulge in the continual debasement of our attention and energy, get
emotionally giddy as its squandered to the ignorant masses. We indulge in its
<a href='commodity.html'>narcistic promotion</a>, revel in slowly becoming a
greater center of attention; a center that becomes defined by various
artificially created <a href='simulacra.html'>boundaries</a>. </p>

<p>The social media user does not post for enjoyment, they enjoy the indulgent
masochism of its dopamine exhaustion, they indulge in it as they do a deep
autumn depression, with an unconsciously mechanical action which draws them
from their potential as a Being. Stripped to the core there is nothing new
here, what is found once more is one's lust for sleep.<a

<q>A long-continuing day was given to them for the life they loved so much, for
they died not by grievous ills consumed, but as o'ercome by sleep.</q>

<p>I asked one Amish person why they didn't use automobiles. He simply smiled and
turned to me and said, "Look what they did to your society." And I asked "what
do you mean? "Well, do you know your neighbor? Do you know the names of your
neighbors?" And, at the time, I had to admit to the fact that I didn't.</p>

<p>And he pointed out that my ability to simply bypass them with the windows
closed meant I didn't have to talk to them. And as a result, I didn't. </p>

	<p>If we are surrounded by life, why is the universe silent? Shouldn't the whole
universe be a noisy social media feed, everyone vying for everyone else's
attention? The dark forest theory explaining that communication, because it
reveals our existence to others, is a sign of stupidity rather than
intelligence.</p>

<p>Sciences become respectable by confining themselves to the feasible, and that
is precisely what computing science did: it focussed its attention on the
intellectual challenge of how to specify and design reliable software systems
of great sophistication. In doing so, it came to a few unescapable conclusions,
all clarifying and inspiring for the computing scientists involved, and each of
them unacceptable to the world at large, that refused to part from its
cherished dreams.<a
