<h2>Oquonie is a textless isometric puzzle game.</h2>

<p>You must make your way through a seemingly endless succession of rooms. You
will not be alone. Your incarnations will have the help of <i>bizaroid</i>
characters that speak an <a href='camilare.html'>an obscure language</a>.</p>

<p>Rekka and I began Oquonie while living in <a href='japan.html'>japan</a>. The
game was our first collaborative project as <a
href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a>, and a reflection of our
experience navigating a new country, with language as a recurent obstacle.
Oquonie is about being lost in a foreign space.</p>

<p>A big inspiration for this project was the short story "A town without
streets" by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito'
target='_blank'>Junji Ito</a>, about a city of endless interconnecting houses
and rooms, where privacy is non-existent. To preserve the little privacy they
do have, the townspeople wear masks.</p>

<p>Back in 2013, we both had full-time jobs in different studios in Tokyo, we
worked on Oquonie after work, on weekends and during part of our time in
Thailand for a total of 6 months. In 2018, we took the game off the Apple Store
after repeated breaking updates and the size of the development toolchain(X
Code) becoming increasingly incompatible with our seafaring life.</p>

<p>In 2023, we remade the game as a <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> rom,
written in our own programming language and ecosystem with the hope that the
virtual machine layer would help with portability and support for the
foreseeable future. You can learn more about the development of the project <a

<p>Oquonie features an original <a href='oquonie_soundtrack.html'>soundtrack</a>,
and was best described as <a
href='http://killscreendaily.com/articles/oquonie-maze-worth-entering/'
target='_blank'>Animal Crossing in a K-Hole</a>. We also released a paper
version of the game, called the <a href='oquonie_walkthrough.html'>Oquonie
Walkthrough</a>.</p>
