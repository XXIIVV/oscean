<h2>Oquonie is a textless isometric puzzle game.</h2>

<p>You must make your way through a seemingly endless succession of rooms. You
will not be alone. Your incarnations will have the help of <i>bizaroid</i>
characters that speak an <a href='camilare.html'>an obscure language</a>.</p>

<p>Rekka and I began Oquonie while living in <a href='japan.html'>Japan</a>. The
game was our first collaborative project as <a
href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a>, and a reflection of our
experience navigating a new country, with language as a recurent obstacle.
Oquonie is about being lost in a foreign space.</p>

<p>A big inspiration for this project was the short story "A town without
streets" by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito'
target='_blank'>Junji Ito</a>, about a city of endless interconnecting houses
and rooms, where privacy is non-existent. To preserve the little privacy they
do have, the townspeople wear masks.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Back in 2013, we both had full-time jobs in different studios in <a
href='tokyo.html'>Tokyo</a>, we worked on Oquonie after work, on weekends and
during part of our time in Thailand for a total of 6 months. In 2018, we took
the game off the Apple Store after repeated breaking updates and the size of
the development toolchain(X Code) becoming increasingly incompatible with our
seafaring life.</p>

<p>In 2023, we remade the game as a <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> rom,
written in our own <a href='uxntal.html'>programming language</a> and ecosystem
with the hope that the virtual machine layer would help with portability and
support for the foreseeable future. You can learn more about the development of
the project <a href='https://100r.ca/site/oquonie.html'

<p>Oquonie features an original <a href='oquonie_soundtrack.html'>soundtrack</a>,
and was best described as <a
href='http://killscreendaily.com/articles/oquonie-maze-worth-entering/'
target='_blank'>Animal Crossing in a K-Hole</a>. We also released a paper
version of the game, called the <a href='oquonie_walkthrough.html'>Oquonie
Walkthrough</a>.</p>
