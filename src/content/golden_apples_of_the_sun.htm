<article>I went out to the hazel wood,<br />Because a fire was in my head,<br />And cut and peeled a hazel wand,<br />And hooked a berry to a thread;<br />And when white moths were on the wing,<br />And moth-like stars were flickering out,<br />I dropped the berry in a stream<br />And caught a little silver trout.<br /><br />When I had laid it on the floor<br />I went to blow the fire a-flame,<br />But something rustled on the floor,<br />And someone called me by my name:<br />It had become a glimmering girl<br />With apple blossom in her hair<br />Who called me by my name and ran<br />And faded through the brightening air.<br /><br />Though I am old with wandering<br />Through hollow lands and hilly lands,<br />I will find out where she has gone,<br />And kiss her lips and take her hands;<br />And walk among long dappled grass,<br />And pluck till time and times are done,<br />The silver apples of the moon,<br />The golden apples of the sun.<br /><br />/William Butler Yeats<br />/The Song of Wandering Aengus <br />/1897</article>
