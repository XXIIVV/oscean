	<li>You may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down your competitors.</li>
	<li>The creatures who act as though they belong to the world follow the peace-keeping law, they give the creatures around them a chance to grow toward watever it's possible for them to become. That's how man came into being, the australopithecus didn't imagine that the world belonged to them, so they let him live and grow.</li>
	<li>You must absolutely and forever relinquish the idea that you know who should live and who should die on this planet.</li>
</ul>
