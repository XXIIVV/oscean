<article>How vainly men themselves amaze<br />To win the palm, the oak, or bays,<br />And their uncessant labours see<br />Crown’d from some single herb or tree,<br />Whose short and narrow verged shade<br />Does prudently their toils upbraid;<br />While all flow’rs and all trees do close<br />To weave the garlands of repose.<br /><br />Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,<br />And Innocence, thy sister dear!<br />Mistaken long, I sought you then<br />In busy companies of men;<br />Your sacred plants, if here below,<br />Only among the plants will grow.<br />Society is all but rude,<br />To this delicious solitude.<br /><br />No white nor red was ever seen<br />So am’rous as this lovely green.<br />Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,<br />Cut in these trees their mistress’ name;<br />Little, alas, they know or heed<br />How far these beauties hers exceed!<br />Fair trees! wheres’e’er your barks I wound,<br />No name shall but your own be found.<br /><br />When we have run our passion’s heat,<br />Love hither makes his best retreat.<br />The gods, that mortal beauty chase,<br />Still in a tree did end their race:<br />Apollo hunted Daphne so,<br />Only that she might laurel grow;<br />And Pan did after Syrinx speed,<br />Not as a nymph, but for a reed.<br /><br />What wond’rous life in this I lead!<br />Ripe apples drop about my head;<br />The luscious clusters of the vine<br />Upon my mouth do crush their wine;<br />The nectarine and curious peach<br />Into my hands themselves do reach;<br />Stumbling on melons as I pass,<br />Ensnar’d with flow’rs, I fall on grass.<br /><br />Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,<br />Withdraws into its happiness;<br />The mind, that ocean where each kind<br />Does straight its own resemblance find,<br />Yet it creates, transcending these,<br />Far other worlds, and other seas;<br />Annihilating all that’s made<br />To a green thought in a green shade.<br /><br />Here at the fountain’s sliding foot,<br />Or at some fruit tree’s mossy root,<br />Casting the body’s vest aside,<br />My soul into the boughs does glide;<br />There like a bird it sits and sings,<br />Then whets, and combs its silver wings;<br />And, till prepar’d for longer flight,<br />Waves in its plumes the various light.<br /><br />Such was that happy garden-state,<br />While man there walk’d without a mate;<br />After a place so pure and sweet,<br />What other help could yet be meet!<br />But ’twas beyond a mortal’s share<br />To wander solitary there:<br />Two paradises ’twere in one<br />To live in paradise alone.<br /><br />How well the skillful gard’ner drew<br />Of flow’rs and herbs this dial new,<br />Where from above the milder sun<br />Does through a fragrant zodiac run;<br />And as it works, th’ industrious bee<br />Computes its time as well as we.<br />How could such sweet and wholesome hours<br />Be reckon’d but with herbs and flow’rs!<br /><br />/Andrew Marvell<br />/1681</article>
