  <tr><td></td><th>Bad Faith</th><th>Good Faith</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Answer</th><td>Jumping into a conversation with endless unapplicable, unrealistic or unrelated answers to the question.</td><td>A clear and honest response to the central point of a question without an aggressive attempt to convince.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Question</th><td>Spouting accusations while cowardly hiding behind the claim of <i>just asking questions</i>, and ignoring the answers. Asking loaded questions.</td><td>A question asked with the intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction.</td></tr>

<h3>Argument Ranking</h3>

<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>●●●●●</td><td>High-level generators</td><td>Disagreements that remain when everyone understands exactly what's being argued, and agrees on what all the evidence says, but have vague and hard-to-define reasons for disagreeing.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●●○</td><td>Operationalizing</td><td>Where both parties understand they're in a cooperative effort to fix exactly what they're arguing about.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○</td><td>Survey of evidence</td><td>Not trying to devastate the other person with a mountain of facts and start looking at the studies and arguments on both sides and figuring out what kind of complex picture they paint.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○</td><td>Disputing definitions</td><td>Argument hinges on the meaning of words, or whether something counts as a member of a category or not.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●○○○</td><td>Single Studies</td><td>Better than scattered facts, proving they at least looked into the issue formally.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●○○○</td><td>Demands for rigor</td><td>Attempts to demand that an opposing argument be held to such strict standards that nothing could possibly clear the bar.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●○○○○</td><td>Single Facts</td><td>One fact, which admittedly does support their argument, but presented as if it solves the debate in and of itself.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●○○○○</td><td>Gotchas</td><td>Short claims that purport to be devastating proof that one side can't possibly be right.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>○○○○○</td><td>Social shaming</td><td>A demand for listeners to place someone outside the boundary of whom deserve to be heard.</td></tr>
