<h3>Argument Ranking</h3>

<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>●●●●●</td><td>High-level generators</td><td>Disagreements that remain when everyone understands exactly what's being argued, and agrees on what all the evidence says, but have vague and hard-to-define reasons for disagreeing.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●●○</td><td>Operationalizing</td><td>Where both parties understand they're in a cooperative effort to fix exactly what they're arguing about.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○</td><td>Survey of evidence</td><td>Not trying to devastate the other person with a mountain of facts and start looking at the studies and arguments on both sides and figuring out what kind of complex picture they paint.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○</td><td>Disputing definitions</td><td>Argument hinges on the meaning of words, or whether something counts as a member of a category or not.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●○○○</td><td>Single Studies</td><td>Better than scattered facts, proving they at least looked into the issue formally.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●○○○</td><td>Demands for rigor</td><td>Attempts to demand that an opposing argument be held to such strict standards that nothing could possibly clear the bar.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●○○○○</td><td>Single Facts</td><td>One fact, which admittedly does support their argument, but presented as if it solves the debate in and of itself.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●○○○○</td><td>Gotchas</td><td>Short claims that purport to be devastating proof that one side can't possibly be right.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>○○○○○</td><td>Social shaming</td><td>A demand for listeners to place someone outside the boundary of whom deserve to be heard.</td></tr>

<h3>Response Ranking</h3>

<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>●●●●●●</td><td>Central point</td><td>Commit to refute explicitly the central point.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●●●○</td><td>Refutation</td><td>Argue a conflicting passage, explain why it's mistaken.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●●○○</td><td>Counterargument</td><td>Contradict with added reasoning or evidence.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○○</td><td>Contradiction</td><td>State the opposing case, what.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●○○○○</td><td>Responding to Tone</td><td>Responding to the author's tone, how.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●○○○○○</td><td>Ad Hominem</td><td>Attacking the author directly, who.</td></tr>

<h3>Emotional Reaction</h3>

<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>Seduction</td><td>You are led to feel that the fulfillment of your dreams depends on your doing what the other is encouraging you to do. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Alignment</td><td>The interests of the system are presented as fulfilling your emotional needs. You are led to feel that your survival, your viability in society or your very identity depends on your doing what the other is requiring of you.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Reduction</td><td>Complex subjects are reduced to a single, emotionally charged issue.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Polarization</td><td>Issues are presented in such a way that you are either right or wrong. You are told that any dialogue between different perspectives is suspect, dangerous or simply not permissible.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Marginalization</td><td>You are made to feel that your own interests (or interests that run counter to the interests of the other) are inconsequential.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Framing</td><td>The terms of a debate are set so that issues that threaten the system cannot be articulated or discussed. You are led to ignore aspects of the issue that may be vitally important to your own interests but are contrary to the interests of the other that is seeking to make you act in their interests.</td></tr>
