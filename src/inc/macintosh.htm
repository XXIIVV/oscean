<h3>Interacting with Mini vMac</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Press Control-M to double the size of the Mini vMac window.</li>
  <li>Press Control-F to enter fullscreen.</li>
  <li>Press Control-S to toggle speed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Importing to the Macintosh</h3>

<p>The boot disk has a few utility programs. One of them is <a href='https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/importfl/' class='external' target='_blank'>ImportFl</a>, which is a special program for use inside of Mini vMac. It will allow you to drag and drop files onto Mini vMac in order to transfer them into the virtual machine. To import a snippet of code into Mini vMac, I use <a href='https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/clipin/index.html' class='external' target='_blank'>ClipIn</a>.</p>

<h3>Exporting from the Macintosh</h3>

<p> You should probably save your project files on a dedicated floppy or hard drive disk image, separate from the boot disk image of the computer. Do not try to make backups of your work by exporting the files directly back into your host OS—unless you're running a classic Mac as your host, the resource fork of your classic Mac files will be lost, and your files will be ruined. Instead, use disk images to store your work from within your emulated virtual machine, and create backups of those disk images in your host OS. Read more about the blank disk images <a href='https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/blanks/index.html' target='_blank' class='external'>here</a>. To export a snippet of code from Mini vMac, I use <a href='https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/clipout/index.html' class='external' target='_blank'>ClipOut</a>.</p>

<h3>Importing images to Hypercard</h3>

<p>To import an image from the host operating system into <a href='hypertalk.html'>hypercard</a>, I generally use the <a href='zoe_format.html'>.zoe file format</a>, to do so, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open image in <a href='noodle.html'>noodle</a>, and export <a href='zoe_format.html'>.zoe</a>.</li>
  <li>Select ImportFl in Mini vMac, and drag the .zoe file from the host OS, onto the emulator window.</li>
  <li>Open the imported file, with <a href='zoe_format.html'>Zoe Suit</a>.</li>
  <li>Save a macintosh native .pict file, and copy/paste the newly created file into Hypercard.</li>
</ol>
