		<p>One day many years ago a man walked along and stood in the sound of the ocean on a cold sunless shore and said:</p>
		<p>"We need a voice to call across the water, to warn ships; I'll make one. I'll make a voice like all of time and all of the fog that ever was; I'll make a voice that is like an empty bed beside you all night long, and like an empty house when you open the door, and like trees in autumn with no leaves. A sound like the birds flying south, crying, and a sound like November wind and the sea on the hard, cold shore."</p>
		<p>"I'll make a sound that's so alone that no one can miss it, that whoever hears it will weep in their souls, and hearths will seem warmer, and being inside will seem better to all who hear it in the distant towns. </p>
		<p>I'll make me a sound and an apparatus and they'll call it a Fog Horn and whoever bears it will know the sadness of eternity and the briefness of life."</p>

	TYPE : album
	BREF : This wiki is a digital playground and personal logging system.
	BODY
		<p>The aim of this wiki is to build a form of <b>personal assistant</b> to help with the management of a vast repository of recorded statistics which includes {tracker daily logs}, notes on {index various projects} and {mirrors curated pages of general knowledge}.</p>
		<p>{Oscean} is written in portable {ansi_c ANSI C} to be compiled on the {Plan9} operating system, and maintained from {hardware low-power devices}. It is built to adapt to my needs as they change, and to {longtermism technology as it evolves}. The databases are in the {tablatal tbtl}/{indental ndtl} human-readable plaintext formats.</p>
		<p>Each part of this project should aim to persist across {longtermism Technological Long Term}, not one part of it should rely on heavy dependencies. — Every function should be <b>specific</b>, <b>unobfuscated</b>, and each one carefully chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.</p>
		<p>Using this tool should be <b>frictionless and undisruptive</b>, its formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, interpretable and text-editable. Only through <b>open sources, open standards, human-readable formats</b> and their independencies, might they survive this fleeting age of self-destructing informatics.</p>
		<p>These attributes should not only be <b>perceptible in its design</b>, <br />but deeply <b>rooted in its code</b>.</p>
		<p>This type of website is a often referred to as a "memex", a kind of archive and mirror of everything that one has done, that one has learnt. It's a living document that outlines where one has been, and a tool that advises where one could go.</p>
		<q>Consider a future device, a sort of mechanized private library in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.</q>

	BODY
		<p>Players start with 9 attached items on their back, and the goal is to strip the other player of their items.</p>
		<p>When items are removed, they clutter up the playing area, making it even more chaotic and hilarious. The washing machine and sink in the background can also fall and bounce around!</p>
		<p>Winning game of the Montreal edition of the Global Game Jam 2012, Volkenessen is a 2D Fighting game developed by {http://theinstructionlimit.com/ Renaud Bedard} and myself.</p>
		{^youtube VheiqV4AuRE}
		<p>To hit the other player, you need to get close to him by hitting away from him, then hit him by moving away from him. Ramming into the opponent just doesn't do it, you need to throw punches, and depending on the impact velocity, even that might not be enough. You can throw double-punches to make sure you land a solid hit and take off an item.</p>

PICO BATTLE
	HOST : collegiennes
	BREF : Pico Battle is a colour-based multiplayer battle puzzler.
	BODY
		<p>You must learn to build shields to defend yourself against incoming colors.</p>{http://theinstructionlimit.com/ Renaud Bedard} and I showcased an experimental game at <b>Prince of the Arcade</b> last year but, between {volkenessen}, {diluvium} and {waiting_for_horus}, only got back to release it now.
		{^youtube et58Ndob9M4}
		<p>Unlike our last game, text-heavy {diluvium}, <b>Pico Battle</b> is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.</p>
		<p>Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.</p>
		<p>To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.</p>
		<p>To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent's shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon's bullets.</p>

	BREF : The Feu era is known as the era of time which began at the End Of Science.
	BODY
		<p>From the moment {actors Teleogic Constructors} began altering the {soies Courses of Time} and will events into happening, traditional rational intelligence and curiosity were then seen as no more than crafts, or relics of a older time.</p>
		<p>As per <b>Neon Hermetism</b>, the whole dimensionality of Time is of a finished shape; accessible and {soies traversible}. It is hypothetized that the universe is an operating function, rendering a final organization of space via the {Ehrivevnv}. In order words, the universe exists to formulate a being which is to enter the celestial puzzle, and to emerge as the resulting value.</p>

ACTORS
	HOST : neon hermetism
	BREF : The Actors are beings unaffected by determinism, that have free will.
	BODY
		<p>Their name "<i>actor</i>" comes from their ability to actually <b>act</b>, outside of the will of {mirrors determinism}.</p>
		<p>Natural Actors, or anomalies, were found to have existed before the {feu}, but the True Age of Actors came about with the synthesis of the first Actor by {neonev} and the Immigrants.</p>
		<p>The first synthesized {actors actor} was tasked to position itself into the {longest_end}, meaning that it would effectively take control of all things, and of all of time, to steer the sequence of events allowing itself to exist within the {longest_end longest lasting possible timeline} of the computing occurrence.</p>

		<p>The puzzle is orbited by both {dinaisth}, and {aitasla}. Its discovery, and the research that it inspired, ultimately brought about the {feu completion of Science}.</p>
		<p>This superstructure is located further than natural light could ever reach, blanketed in perpetual darkness and cold, in near infinite space and {vetetrandes stasized time}. The only light ever to reach the surface of the puzzle is emited from {dinaisth}.</p>

		<p>In other words, by generating the first events outside of the renderable, or Possible World, the {actors} steer themselves inside and outside of the possible and impossible chain of events, granting themselves access to various normaly impossible actions.</p>

		<p>I have aligned my life toward a singular design, the <b>acceleration of Arts & Science</b>.</p>
		<p>The analysis of {horaire personal statistics} recorded through {routine daily journaling}, revealed that {travel} converts into the most {horaire hours of inspiration}. From this insight, I have oriented my creative work toward facilitating opportunities to travel.</p>
		<p>Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity. Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period of a year showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad — showed an improvement in the realization of <i>Arts & Sciences</i>.</p>
		<p>Automating work always converted to higher long-term output than attempts at brute force. Building specific {tools} mostly returned higher performance than {about learning general purpose tools}.</p><q>Optimizing toward the <b>need for less revenue</b> has yielded better results than optimizing toward the generation of more.</q>
		<p>Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, against acting impulsively and making possible accidental steps away from the acceleration of <i>Arts & Sciences</i>.</p>
		<p>I have kept journals recording the oscillation of <b>Efficiency</b> and <b>Effectiveness</b>, and used this data to optimize and navigate my own personal tempers of productivity. Based on previously recorded patterns, I assign to myself each day a single task to complete. The task is chosen specifically to utilize the optimal amount of available stamina.</p>
		<p>When a workday ends before the daily task is completed, the day was a planning failure; and the task is broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When a task is completed too early, the day is also a planning failure.</p>

NOMAD
	HOST : lifestyle
	BREF : The Nomad diaries.
	BODY
		<p>My first encounter with a <i>sailing nomad</i> was during my stay in {czech Prague}. There was a time when I may have felt homesick, but <i>Home</i> was suddenly becoming an increasingly vague concept shedding the meaning it previously held.</p>
		<p>The monthly rent of our beach-side appartment in Tokyo was of about 1.75K$, and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing. The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month — Or that by halving the costs of our current living situation, we could become both "homeowners" while keeping our traveling options open.</p>
		<p>To think that, at the time, the harder things to let go of were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — When the truly hard things to let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection. </p>
		<p>But surely I did not do all this travel for the travel alone, I must have had passions, habits and goals before I left — Everything that used to define me is beginning to feel increasingly like {deliberate distractions}, simulations to protect me from truly experiencing anything. I had never let myself feel cold, I had never felt hunger.</p>
		<p>The wind rocks the ship sideways, keeping me up at night, but all I can feel is that humbling sense of being present and part of nature. I have long forgotten about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, I began to wonder why people even feel the need to take showers every day, and time away from social networks really does make me feel better.</p><q>I traded the things I thought I cared about, for things I didn't know existed.</q>
		<p>Eventually, I got back to building things, I learned how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live without power.</p>
		<p>We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with dolphins, we have climbed mountains on deserted islands, and we have met the most amazing people. When it is our time to go, we will have no regrets, for we were fortunate to have seen more than we could ever hope for.</p>

DELIBERATE
	HOST : lifestyle
	BREF : Notes on other things related to sociality.
	BODY
		<p>If you ask us why we decided to go sailing, we don't think we could give you a straight answer. Even the authors of our sailing manuals cannot explain what might compel anyone to do it, even after being made aware of the many perils of an ocean. Why would anyone do something with a very real risk of not making it back to shore, and furthermore, for no obvious reward?</p>
		<p>It seems unjustifiable, or at least masochistic, that a person would wilfully put themselves through potential misadventures for fame and curiosity alone, mountain climbers might echo these feelings although we don't know any with whom we can verify this. And so, perhaps we do these things in the name of freedom, freedom to practice direct experience (with all that entails. Discomfort, pain, hunger and so on), here we shall name this calling <b>to live deliberately</b>, using Thoreau's words.</p>
		<h3>Living by proxies</h3>
		<p>Smart devices to take away the pain of thinking deep thoughts, social things against the solitude, forever removing ourselves, in exchange for protectedness, for a complete thoughtless socialized inexistence.</p>
		<p>A creeping numbness might be to blame for our own search of this direct experience, in the form of long distance sailing, to let ourselves feel cold so we could sense the subtler changes in the weather, to go hungry to appreciate simpler foods.</p>
		<p>Similarly, one might begin to talk instead of watching talk-shows and to play instead of watching game shows — To value the entire spectrum of sensations as necessary members of the whole that is the deliberate existence, with its potential for failure, awkwardness, loneliness, harm and death included.</p>
		<h3>To feel secure</h3>
		<p>Convenience products will protect those living at odds with nature. Novel and fashionable horrors will be popularized to subvert anyone into docility, else new fears will be provided as obedience demands.</p><p>In the name of security, a modern citizen will be thoroughly handled. A modern civilisation will deem itself total as it finally does away with all inconveniences, vanquished the totality of the Unknowable, the Indifferent, the Unorganizeable, of Nature, by means of paving over it.</p>
		<p>We have seen the non-participation to the throughput mechanisms of society labeled as escapism, but we look at it in reverse where one escapes by being apart from nature. An illusory sense of dominion and domestication of nature might make one think of it as a place where one can escape to, and this is re-enforced when seen through the lense of a synthetic protective layer of proxies and simulations, but the protective layer doesn't curve outward upon nature, but inward upon the individual. And that is absolute escapism.</p>
		<p>We believe that one can use nature's indifference as a reminder of the actual fortitude of their being, to learn of one's own true capacity for resilience when communing with nature — Ideas altogether at odds with modern stories, or an invitation to be part of something.</p>
		<p><i>This edited version of the text was written as closing words for the {hundred_rabbits Hundred Rabbits} North Pacific Crossing Logbook, read it {https://100r.co/site/north_pacific_logbook.html here}.</i></p>
		<q>To minimize suffering and to maximize security were natural and proper ends of society and Caesar. But then they became the only ends, somehow, and the only basis of law — a perversion. Inevitably, then, in seeking only them, we found only their opposites: maximum suffering and minimum security.</q>

LONGTERMISM
	HOST : lifestyle
	BREF : Notes on Longtermism and sustainability.
	BODY
		<p>In an age of disposable smart devices and unrepairable electronics, there are few topics that occupy my mind as much as <b>solutioning for technological resilience</b>.</p>
		<p>Living aboard a {pino sailboat}, away from reliable internet connectivity, outside of delivery networks, forces us to explore ways with which we can strenghten and simplify the toolset onto which we rely.</p>
		<p>We must abandon 3-in-1 packages, bloated always-online services and general planned obsolesce, and establish practices of recyclism, minimum viable products, small-sharp modular utilities. We see smart and resilience as opposing attributes to a device, smart is inherently contrary to a single purpose tool, and thus incompatible with longtermism.</p>
		<p>Our focus over the past years has gradually shifted toward open-source software and modular(combinable) electronics. Looking back, we are proud of the open-source tools that we created, enabling a handful of people to exit subscription services, and inscrutable closed-source utilities. Moving forward, we begin to consider hardware, or at least software that resides closer to the metal.</p>
		<p>I periodically find myself thinking about operating systems, or more specifically the interaction design of OSes. In attempting to tackle the difficult UX challenges of that space, unrealizing that my failure to solve these issues might very well come from the simple fact that the purpose of operating systems is to enable multi-tasking, multi-tasking that I try to eradicate from my daily life, making these issues deeply unsolvable and my love for sharp tools and OSes irreconcilable.</p>
		<p>Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't re-orient our focus onto things that can run on small low-power open-source single-purpose boards, but I also consider the impact of pushing for the production of more electronics as problematic, perhaps creating software targeting old hardware might be what I'm looking for.</p>
		<p>Despite all this, I dream of a line of simple electronics, each one designed for a single purpose. Or even for things beyond the realm of electronics, like a kit bicyle with all its superfluousities removed — As it becomes increasingly difficult to find simple models with easily serviceable parts.</p>
		<p>My dream sailboat has no diesel engine, no fuel outboard and no lead acid battery storage, but instead a compressed air engine with its compression stored in diving tanks, a bike crank powered compressor, a hydro generator pump, and a dynamo to charge our low-power electronics. The only crucial electronic systems connected to the house tanks would be the AIS transceiver, the VHF radio, a basic chartplotter and habitat lighting. Our work and entertainment electronics, like our laptops and cameras, would run off solar charging a minimal array of standard batteries.</p>
		<p>Is there a way to create and distribute software and electronics in a way that is environmentally conscious? perhaps {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth not}.</p>

		<p>Fruits, seeds, vegetables, nuts, grains, grasses, roots, Rowers, herbs, berries-all are collected when they have ripened, and when their collection is in the interest of the garden's heightened and continued vitality. Harvesting respects a source, leaves it unexploited, suffers it to be as it is. Animals cannot be harvested. They mature, but they do not "ripen." They are killed not when they have completed the cycle of their vitality but when they are at the peak of their vitality.</p>

AUDIO FAQS
	HOST : faqs
	BREF : Answers to commonly asked questions about audio.
	BODY
		<h4>What inspired you to play music?</h4>
		<p>I knew that I should want to write my own {audio music} when I was at a chiptune concert, I realized at that moment that I could write music with non-traditional and custom-made instruments.</p>
		<h4>When were you first introduced to chiptune music?</h4>
		<p>At the Gamma Festival in Montreal, Bubblyfish was the first performing chiptune act that I ever saw.</p>
		<h4>What kind of music do you play and why?</h4>
		<p>I tend to navigate the space between ambient and industrial music, I write starkly contrasted rhythmic music as I find it best to describe the environments explored in the songs.</p>
		<h4>What themes are you trying to uncover in your music?</h4>
		<p>Most of the music I write as {aliceffekt} is about a character's travels across the frigid scapes of this fictional world called the {neauismetica}, on this foreign planet called {dinaisth}.</p>
		<h4>Why did you decide to accompany your music with visuals?</h4>
		<p>The visuals came first, and I wrote the music to accompany the drawings. So the music merely accompany the visuals.</p>
		<h4>Do you have a set of tracks you play regularly?</h4>
		<p>I tend to write music for specific events that occur in the Neauismetica, and when I perform live, I pick moments which best fit with the other performers.</p>
		<h4>What is your approach when you perform live?</h4>
		<p>It depends, sometimes it's improvisational, like the {telekinetic} show. Or sometimes it's procedural, like the {ehrivevnv_studies}, where I merely make sure that everything is tuned properly. Sometimes I mix old songs and focus on building interesting visuals if the venue allows for it. As of late, I have been livecoding, where the song writing is done as a performance.</p>
		<h4>How do you approach songwriting?</h4>
		<p>I tend to write the song in my head entirely, and put it down in one setting. I often write music about the Neauismetica, it's a kind of mental place, a pool of endless musical idea I can visit and explore, it's where most of the songs come from.</p>
		<h4>When performing live, what's your setup like?</h4>
		<p>It varies, I've written a couple of shows to be performed with a {studio specific synth}, or a specific hardware like with the LeapMotion. Typically, I just use a combination of midi controllers and livecoding.</p>
		<h4>What instruments do you play?</h4>
		<p>None. I've never been too not much interested in music interpretation, my love is for composition and synthesis.</p>
		<h4>Where does the name Aliceffekt comes from?</h4>
		<p>Alice Effekt was a {https://youtu.be/VSKXfDMpqns?t=51m8s track by Drome} that I liked a lot when I started writing music. My goal was to write music just like it. But it has since evolved into something else.</p>

VISUAL FAQS
	HOST : faqs
	BREF : Answers to commonly asked questions about visual.
	BODY
		<h4>Which creative discipline did you begin with, and how did you shift to other mediums?</h4>
		<p>At first, I stumbled onto photo manipulation. From DeviantArt, to Raster and to Depthcore, I was moving from working with {photography photos}, to {illustration drawing}, and eventually {nereid modeling}. While I enjoyed {visual} arts, I felt that to keep sharpening the rendition of the worlds I was drawing, I needed to add a new dimension and so I began writing soundtracks to the pictures, and eventually putting all of it together in the form of websites, and games.</p>
		<h4>What is the meaning of the glyph in your avatar?</h4>
		<p>It is an old rendition of the character for blue, found in the the Shuowen Jiezi, the character dictionary written by Xu Shen, 100 CE. This particular glyph has probably never been used outside of paleography. I found it to be very beautiful, and the word "blue" has a special meaning in the stories from which my handle {identity neauoire} comes from.</p>
		<h4>What is the significance of your neck tattoo?</h4>
		<p>My tattoo is three dots in the shape of a triangle, or at an equal distance from each other, it signifies audio, visual and research. I call this arrangement "trisight", it's a reminder that, being a generalist, I must constantly pull from these 3 mediums in order to create complete works.</p>
		<h4>Where does your name come from?</h4>
		<p>I began using the name online around 2005, Devine Lu Linvega comes from Davine Lu Linvega of the series {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame! Blame}, by Tsutomu Nihei, which was very influential to me at the time.</p>
		<h4>Why did you choose that name?</h4>
		<p>I had been looking for a name that did <b>not</b> represent who I was, but instead who I would like to become. I wanted something that would serve as a reminder to put curiousity above power, that did not lock myself in the past, but would force me forward toward that ideal.</p>
		<h4>Who is Davine Lu Linvega in the book?</h4>
		<p>She was unique from other antagonists in that she doesn't seem to desire killing humans, instead, she devotes her time and energy into finding a way to access an hyper-evolved version of the Internet in the universe of BLAME. As seen in her dying words, Davine was not motivated by a pursuit for power, but rather wanted to see the Netsphere out of pure curiosity.</p>

RESEARCH FAQS
	HOST : faqs
	BREF : Answers to commonly asked questions about research.
	BODY
		<h4>What are the most important concepts that you impart in your works?</h4>
		<p>A lot of my work deal with foreignness and adaptiveness, some of the most romantic ideas that one will find in my work is that of explorers wandering the remains of a long extinguished civilisation, and trying to make sense of it.</p>
		<h4>Why do you release free software?</h4>
		<p>Being away from accessible internet connectivity, the most practical mean for us to develop and release projects is via {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar the bazaar model}, where the code is often maintained by others while we are away, and so as to not capitalize unfairly on all the help that we receive, we decided to only accept donations.</p>
		<h4>Why do you release open-source software?</h4>
		<p>Being incapable of sitting through a class back in high-school, most of the learning that I was able to do was from looking at other people's sources and trying to make sense of the way they think and understand the reasons for solutioning in that particular way. For an ecosystem of {tools} to be truly resilient, individuals must be able to {longtermism repair, maintain and inspect} the software that they use.</p>
		<h4>Why is journaling important to you?</h4>
		<p>I keep records of everything I make, and everything I consume. The idea is to better understand my creative patterns, and to predict changes in mood and interest. Ultimately, the goal is to plan more efficiently, to spend my time with more efficacy and to work less.</p>

LIFESTYLE FAQS
	HOST : faqs
	BREF : Answers to commonly asked questions about lifestyle.
	BODY
		<h4>What is your background?</h4>
		<p>I was born in March of 1986. I was a notoriously distracted student in high school, I tried attending a few art classes in college before realizing that it was not the right environment to learn the things I was interested into. </p>
		<p>I was first interested in {illustration} and motion graphics. I soon started writing {audio music} to complement the pictures and animations, and finally I began implementing interaction and turn these multimedia pieces into games, websites and tools.</p>
		<h4>Where do you work?</h4>
		<p>I work at a small research studio aboard a sailboat, called {hundred_rabbits Hundred Rabbits}, where we do experiments in resilience and self-reliance using {https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html low-tech solutions}.</p>
		<h4>What do you do during the daytime?</h4>
		<p>The ways in which I spend my time varies wildly from day to day, but mostly experimental research, my interests include alternative ways to store power and minimum viable solutions for {longtermism technological tooling}.</p>
		<h4>What is your routine?</h4>
		<p>I go to bed choosing one thing to accomplish the next day, I wake up to tackle this {routine singular task}. I tend to work only in the morning, get everything done before lunch. The afternoons, I spend mostly reading and learning things to help me solve the next day's task. I usually wake up with the sun, and sleep soon after sunset.</p>
		<h4>Where do you go to get inspired?</h4>
		<p>I share a small forum with a few online friends and whenever I am looking for a new favourite thing, or some help — I know I can find it there. Everyone should build a small network, a place where they can feel comfortable to experiment, show works-in-progress and exchange on the topics of art and science in a safe place among {Merveilles like-minded people}.</p>
		<h4>Why do you think people should travel more?</h4>
		<p>I found {travel} to be a good catalyst toward learning {language new languages}, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity and creativity.</p>
		<h4>How do you draw the line between what is published, and what stays private?</h4>
		<p>Working {identity behind an avatar} and living online through a proxy name offers a good healthy distance between the work and the self.</p>
		<p>The Devine Lu Linvega project focuses on making explicit the reflections, and techniques for the creative process. My intimate life, my health, my friends and family are outside of the scope of this project.</p>

		<p>Solarpunks demand for technology and society to re-centre around sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy. A focus on decentralisation, community activism, social justice and civic empowerment. A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.</p>

ANARCHY
	HOST : ethics
	BREF : Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, ableism, speciesism, and religion. 
	BODY
		<p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.</p>
		<p>For anarchists, anarchy means not necessarily absence of order, as is generally supposed, but an absence of rule. Anarchists wish to create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation.</p>
		<p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price — except at the price of liberty.</p>
		<q>Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.</q>
		<h5>—Clay Shirky</h5>
		<p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.</p>

		<p>The concept of liminality applied as a term for thinking about modern societies is connected to the study of theatre and performance. The <i>liminal</i> experiences of tribal cultures – in which ritual is a collective process for navigating moments of change – are different from the <i>liminoid</i> experiences available in modern societies, which resemble the liminal, but are choices we opt into as individuals, like a night out at the theatre. This distinction comes with a suggestion that true liminality, the collective entry into the liminal, is not available within a complex industrial society.</p>
		<p>Perhaps this has been true. The consequences of that very complex industrial society are now bringing us to a point where we get reacquainted with true liminality. We begin to recognise that we now face a crisis which has no outside.

HYDROGEN
	HOST : notebook
	BREF : Lightest, simplest, most abundant element in the universe. Highest energy content of any common fuel by weight, but the lowest energy content by volume.
	BODY
		<p>It takes about 15 volts to electrolyze pure water, but pure water is not the ideal fuel to begin with, water with electrolytes dissolved in it is. If you live near the ocean, the ideal fuel medium is plain sea water, which has the perfect level of salinity for electrolysis, and requires not 15 volts to separate the hydrogen from the oxygen, but only 1/2 of a volt.</p>
		<h3>Electrolysis</h3>
		<p>The volume of gas produced is proportional to the current passing through the water and the total surface area of the plates. To do this the spacing of the electrodes must be as close as possible while still having enough room for the gas to bubble out freely. A greater surface area also means less resistance and less heat. </p>
		<p>Consider the distance between your plates, if water is an insulator, then the more water you have between two plates, the higher the resistance will be between the plates. The farther apart your plates are, the less amps your cell will draw through the water. The closer the plates are, the more amperage your cell will draw. </p>
		<p>The metal chosen for the plates was special high grade stainless steel to reduce corrosion. Such metal is not as conductive as others like copper for instance, so a few more plates might be used.</p>    
		<p>If we add Electrolytes to the water, we will make the water conduct better by decreasing the Resistance between the plates. A decrease in resistance allows more current to flow thus increasing the possibility of producing more HHO. A cell that has wide spacing can be made to produce just as much HHO as a cell with close spacing. Note, see {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea Urea}.</p>

		<p>A fuel cell is a device that converts a fuel such as hydrogen, alcohol, gasoline, or methane into electricity directly. A hydrogen fuel cell produces electricity without any pollution, since pure water is the only byproduct. </p>
		<p>In a 1976 U.S. Patent, Gutbier and Hohne indicated that hydrogen could be produced via the reaction of magnesium-aluminum mixtures with sea water.</p>

THE SARTRE MECHANISM
	HOST : talk
	BREF : The Sartre Mechanism short.
	BODY
		<p>It was the first day of the winter when a friend invited me to witness the completion of a recent project.</p>
		<p>Crouched over a heap of cogs, she did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine. A distracted gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the busy studio.</p>
		<p>What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be an intricate clocklike mechanism; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the end of a short metallic arm.</p>
		<p>My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto its opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out from its own ticking body and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.</p>
		<p>I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to unbuilding the core, growing forever weakly as it dismantled the remaining components, moving them back into the box. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.</p>
