LANGUAGE SPECIFICATIONS
_______________________________________________________________________________
MEMORY
This language makes use of two registers (register 0 and register 1),
each of which can store one signed integer. It also makes use of a stack of
unlimited size, which can also store signed integers.


INSTRUCTIONS
Every line of input text corresponds to exactly one instruction. The parser
checks each line for the following features and compiles the line to the
instruction listed first in the following list. In the summary of instructions,
"the active register" refers to either register 0 or register 1 depending on
whether the line deviates or not from the left margin. Thus, whitespace IS
significant in both the placement of newlines and the presence of whitespace
characters immediately following said newlines.

1. End rhyme with previous line: If register 0 < register 1, push the number of
syllables present in the previous line to the stack. Otherwise, push the number of
syllables in the current line to the stack.
2. "/" appears in line: If active register > number of syllables in line, goto
line number indicated by non-active register.
3. Capital letter appears within a word: Negate active register
4. Capital letter appears at beginning of word: Multiply registers and store to
active register
5. "like" or "as" appears in line: Add registers and store in indicated
register
6. "?" appears in line: Print ascii character indicated by value of active
register
7. "." appears in line: Print value of active register
8. "," appears in line: Pop stack and store in active register
9. "-" appears in line: Push value of active register to stack
10. Alliteration in consecutive words: Goto line indicated by active register
11. Blank line: no-op
12. Anything else: Store the number of syllables to the active register



EXAMPLE
_______________________________________________________________________________
The following is an example text which implements a recursive algorithm for
calculating factorials. By changing the number of syllables in the title, one
can change the input number.

ANNOTATION
_______________________________________________________________________________

Here is the text again with explanations of what each line does.

other woodwork   # Store number of syllables (4) in register 0 (indicated by no
                 # deviation from left margin)
    like a folding  # Add (keyword: like) register 0 to 1 and store in register
                    # 1 (indicated by deviation from left margin)
   up, a  # Pop (comma) the stack to register 1
  branch-work growth # Push contents of register 1 to the stack
              of  # Store number of syllables (1) in register 1
      AshPaper trees come together  # Negate (capital within word) register 1
as we demand  # Add (keyword: as) register 0 to register 1 and store in

  a Scream of roots  # Multiply (capital in line) registers and store to
                     # register 1
    toe-curled  # Push register 1 to stack 
    inward  # Store number of syllables (2) in register 1
gro(w/a)n  # If register 0 > number of syllables (1), goto line number
           # indicated by register 1
    past lines of pebbles, into wellstones  # Pop stack, store in register 1
                              cracked. broken. # Print value in register 1

EXECUTION

Here is the text as it is read by the machine during execution, with the state
of the registers and stack following execution of each line.
