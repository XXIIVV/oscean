PREFACE

The origin of this Jargon, a conventional language similar to the Lingua Franca of the
Mediterranean, the Negro-English-Dutch of Surinam, the Pigeon English of China, and several
other mixed tongues, dates back to the fur droguers of the last century. Those mariners whose
enterprise in the fifteen years preceding 1800, explored the intricacies of the northwest coast of
America, picked up at their general rendezvous, Nootka Sound, various native words useful in
barter, and thence transplanted them, with additions from the English, to the shores of Oregon.
Even before their day, the coasting trade and warlike expeditions of the northern tribes,
themselves a sea-faring race, had opened up a partial understanding of each other's speech; for
when, in 1792, Vancouver's officers visited Gray's Harbor, they found that the natives, though
speaking a different language, understood many words of the Nootka.

On the arrival of Lewis and Clarke at the mouth of the Columbia, in 1806, the new
language, from the sentences given by them, had evidently attained some form. It was with the
arrival of Astor's party, however, that the Jargon received its principal impulse. Many more
words of English were then brought in, and for the first time the French, or rather the Canadian
and Missouri patois of the French, was introduced. The principal seat of the company being at
Astoria, not only a large addition of Chinook words was made, but a considerable number was
taken from the Chihalis, who immediately bordered that tribe on the north, each owning a portion
of Shoalwater Bay. The words adopted from the several languages were, naturally enough, those
most easily uttered by all, except, of course, that objects new to the natives found their names in
French or English, and such modifications were made in pronunciation as suited tongues
accustomed to different sounds. . Grammatical forms were reduced to their simplest
expression, and variations in mood and tense conveyed only by adverbs or by the context. The
language continued to receive additions, and assumed a more distinct and settled meaning, under
the Northwest and Hudson's Bay companies, who succeeded Astor's party, as well as through the
American settlers in Oregon. Its advantage was soon perceived by the Indians, and the Jargon
became to some extent a means of communication between natives of different speech, as well as
between them and the whites. It was even used as such between Americans and Canadians. It was
at first most in vogue upon the lower Columbia and the Willamette, whence it spread to Puget
Sound, and with the extension of trade, found its way far up the coast, as well as the Columbia
and Fraser rivers; and there are now few tribes between the 42d and 57th parallels of latitude in
which there are not to be found interpreters through its medium. Its prevalence and easy
acquisition, while of vast convenience to traders and settlers, has tended greatly to hinder the
acquirement of the original Indian languages; so much so, that except by a few missionaries and
pioneers, hardly one of them is spoken or understood by white men in all Oregon and Washington
Territory. Notwithstanding its apparent poverty in number of words, and the absence of
grammatical forms, it possesses much more flexibility and power of expression than might be
imagined, and really serves almost every purpose of ordinary intercourse.
The number of words constituting the Jargon proper has been variously stated. Many
formerly employed have become in great measure obsolete, while others have been locally
introduced. Thus, at the Dalles of the Columbia, various terms are common which would not be
intelligible at Astoria or on Puget Sound. In making the following selection, I have included all
those which, on reference to a number of vocabularies, I have found current at any of these
places, rejecting, on the other hand, such as individuals, partially acquainted with the native
languages, have employed for their own convenience. The total number falls a little short of five
hundred words.
