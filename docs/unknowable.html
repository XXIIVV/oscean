<H2>Why LISP?!</H2>
You might expect that a book on the incompleteness theorems would include
material on symbolic logic and that it would present a formal
axiomatic system, for example, Peano arithmetic.  Well, this book won't!
First, because formalisms for deduction failed and formalisms for
computation succeeded.  So instead I'll show you a beautiful and
highly mathematical formalism for expressing algorithms, LISP.  The
other important reason for showing you LISP instead of a formal
axiomatic system is that I can prove incompleteness results in a very
general way without caring about the internal details of the formal
axiomatic system.  To me a formal axiomatic system is like a black box
that theorems come out of.  My methods for obtaining incompleteness
theorems are so general that all I need to know is that there's a
proof-checking algorithm.
<P>
So this is a post-modern book on incompleteness!  If you
look at another little book on incompleteness, Nagel & Newman's
<I>G&ouml;del's Proof,</I> which I enjoyed greatly as a child,
you'll see plenty of material on symbolic logic, and <B>no</B>
material on computing.  In my opinion the right way to think about all
this now is to start with computing, not with logic.  So that's the
way I'm going to do things here.  There's no point in writing this
book if I do everything the way everyone else does!
<P>
LISP means ``list processing,'' and was invented by John McCarthy and
others at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab around 1960.  You
can do numerical calculations in LISP, but it's really intended for
symbolic calculations.  In fact LISP is really a computerized version
of set theory, at least set theory for finite sets.  It's a simple but
very powerful mathematical formalism for expressing algorithms, and
I'm going to use it in Chapters 
<a href=ch3.html>III,</a> <a href=ch4.html>IV</a> & <a href=ch5.html>V</a> to present G&ouml;del,
Turing's and my work in detail.  The idea is to start with a small
number of powerful concepts, and get everything from that.  So LISP,
the way I do it, is more like mathematics than computing.
<P>
And LISP is rather different from ordinary work-a-day programming
languages, because instead of executing or running programs you think
about evaluating expressions.  It's an expression-based or functional
programming language rather than a statement-based imperative
programming language.
<P>
Two versions of
the LISP interpreter for this book are available at my web site:
one is <A HREF="lisp.m">300 lines of <I>Mathematica</I></A>, and the other is
<A HREF="lisp.c">a thousand lines of <I>C</I></A>.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>S-expressions, lists & atoms, the empty list</H2>
The basic concept in LISP is that of a <I>symbolic</I> or
S-expression.  What's an S-expression?  Well, an S-expression is
either an <I>atom</I>, which can either be a natural number like 345
or a word like Frederick, or it's a <I>list</I> of atoms or sub-lists.
Here are three examples of S-expressions:
<blockquote>
(),  (a b c), (+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6))
</blockquote>
The first example is the empty list (), also called <I>nil</I>.  The
second example is a list of three elements, the atoms <I>a</I>,
<I>b</I> and <I>c</I>.  And the third example is a list of three
elements.  The first is the atom +, and the second and the third are
lists of three elements, which are atoms.  And you can nest lists to
arbitrary depth.  You can have lists of lists of lists...
<P>
The empty list () is the only list that's also an atom, it has no
elements.  It's indivisible, which is what atom means in Greek.  It
can't be broken into smaller pieces.
<P>
Elements of a list can be repeated, e.g., (a a a).  And changing the order
of the elements changes the list.  So (a b c) is <B>not</B> the same
as (c b a) even though it has the same elements, because they are in a
different order.  Hence <I>lists</I> are different from <I>sets</I>, where
elements cannot be repeated and the order of the elements is
irrelevant.
<P>
Now in LISP <B>everything</B>, programs, data, and output, they are
all S-expressions.  That's our universal substance, that's how we
build everything!
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Arithmetic in LISP</H2>
Let's look at some simple LISP expressions, expressions for doing arithmetic.
For example, here is an arithmetic expression that adds the
product of 3 and 4 to the product of 5 and 6:
<blockquote>
3*4 + 5*6
</blockquote>
The first step to convert this to LISP is to put in <B>all</B> the
parentheses:
<blockquote>
((3*4) + (5*6))
</blockquote>
And the next step to convert this to LISP is to put the operators before
the operands (prefix notation), rather than in the middle
(infix notation):
<blockquote>
(+(*34)(*56))
</blockquote>
And now we need to use blanks to separate the elements of a list if parentheses don't
do that for us.  So the final result is
<blockquote>
(+(* 3 4)(* 5 6))
</blockquote>
which is already understandable, or
<blockquote>
(+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6))
</blockquote>
which is the standard LISP notation in which the successive elements of a
list are always separated by a single blank.  Extra blanks, if
included, are ignored.  Extra parentheses are <B>not</B> ignored, they
completely change the meaning of an S-expression.
<blockquote>
(((X))) is <B>not</B> the same as X!
</blockquote>
<P>
What are the built-in operators, i.e., the primitive functions, that are
provided for doing arithmetic in LISP?  Well, in my LISP there's addition +,
multiplication *, subtraction -, exponentiation ^, and, for
comparisons, less-than <, greater-than >, equal =, less-than-or-equal
<=, and greater-than-or-equal >=.  I only provide natural numbers in my LISP, so
there are no negative integers.  If the result of a subtraction is
less than zero, it gives 0 instead.  Comparisons either give
<I>true</I> or <I>false</I>.  All these operators, or functions,
always have two operands, or arguments.  Addition and multiplication of
more than two operands requires several + or * operations.  Here
are examples of arithmetic expressions in LISP, together with their values.
<blockquote>
(+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 4))) is the same as (+ 1 (+ 2 7))
is the same as (+ 1 9) which yields 10, <BR>
(+ (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)) is the same as (+ 3 7) which yields 10, <BR>
(- 10 7) yields 3, <BR>
(- 7 10) yields 0, <BR>
(+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6)) is the same as (+ 12 30) which yields 42,  <BR>
(^ 2 10) yields 1024, <BR>
(< (* 10 10) 101) is the same as (< 100 101) which yields true, <BR>
(= (* 10 10) 101) is the same as (= 100 101) which yields false.
</blockquote>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>M-expressions</H2>
In addition to the official LISP S-expressions, there are also
<I>meta</I> or M-expressions.  These are just intended to be helpful,
as a convenient abbreviation for the official S-expressions.
Programmers usually write M-expressions, and then the LISP
interpreter converts them into S-expressions before processing them.
M-expressions omit some of the parentheses, the ones that group
the primitive built-in functions together with their arguments.
M-expression notation works because all
built-in primitive functions in my LISP have a fixed-number of
operands or arguments.  Here are the M-expressions for the above
examples.
<blockquote>
+ 1 + 2 + 3 4 is the same as (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 4))), <BR>
+ + 1 2 + 3 4 is the same as (+ (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)), <BR>
- 10 7 is the same as (- 10 7), <BR>
- 7 10 is the same as (- 7 10), <BR>
+ * 3 4 * 5 6 is the same as (+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6)),  <BR>
^ 2 10 is the same as (^ 2 10), <BR>
< * 10 10 101 is the same as (< (* 10 10) 101), <BR>
= * 10 10 101 is the same as (= (* 10 10) 101).
</blockquote>
If you look at these examples you can convince yourself that there is
never any ambiguity in restoring the missing parentheses, if you know
how many arguments each operator has.  So M-expressions are
an example of what used to be called parenthesis-free or Polish
notation.
[This is in honor of a brilliant school of
Polish logicians and set theorists.]
<P>
There are circumstances in which one wants to give parentheses
explicitly rather than implicitly.  So I use the notation " 
within an M-expression
to indicate
that what follows is an S-expression.  Here are
three examples:
<blockquote>
The M-expression "(+ + +) denotes the S-expression (+ + +). <BR>
The M-expression ("+ "- "*) denotes the S-expression (+ - *). <BR>
The M-expression + "* "^ denotes the S-expression (+ * ^). <BR>
</blockquote>
If one didn't use the double quotes, these arithmetic operators would
have to have operands, but here they are just used as symbols.  But
these are not useful S-expressions, because they are not valid
arithmetical expressions.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Recursive definitions & factorial</H2>
Now let me jump ahead and give the traditional first example of a complete
LISP program.  Later I'll explain everything in more detail.  So
here is how you define factorial in LISP.  What's factorial?  Well,
the factorial of <I>N</I>, usually denoted <I>N</I>!, is the product
of all natural numbers from 1 to <I>N</I>.  So how do we do this in
LISP?  Well, we define factorial recursively:
<blockquote>
(define (fact N) (if (= N 0) [then] 1 [else] (* N (fact (- N 1)))))
</blockquote>
Here comments are enclosed in square brackets.  This is the definition
in the official S-expression notation.  Here the definition is written
in the more convenient M-expression notation.
<blockquote>
define (fact N) <BR> if = N 0 [then] 1 <BR>
	[else]   * N (fact - N 1)
</blockquote>
This can be interpreted unambiguously if you know that
``define'' always has two operands, and ``if'' always has three.
<P>
Let's state this definition in words.
<P>
The factorial function has one argument, <I>N</I>, and is defined as
follows.  If <I>N</I> is equal to 0 then factorial of <I>N</I> is
equal to 1.  Otherwise factorial of <I>N</I> is equal to <I>N</I>
times factorial of <I>N</I> minus 1.
<P>
So using this definition, we see that (fact 4) is the same as
<blockquote>
(* 4 (fact 3)) <BR>
(* 4 (* 3 (fact 2))) <BR>
(* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (fact 1)))) <BR>
(* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (* 1 (fact 0))))) <BR>
(* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (* 1 1)))) <BR>
(* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1))) <BR>
(* 4 (* 3 2)) <BR>
(* 4 6)
</blockquote>
which yields 24.
<P>
So in LISP you define functions instead of indicating how to calculate
them.  The LISP interpreter's job is to figure out how to calculate
them using their definitions.  And instead of loops, in LISP you use
recursive function definitions.  In other words, the function that you
are defining recurs in its own definition.  The general idea is to
reduce a complicated case of the function to a simpler case, etc.,
etc., until you get to cases where the answer is obvious.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Manipulating lists: car, cdr, cons</H2>
The examples I've given so far are all numerical arithmetic.  But LISP
is actually intended for symbolic processing.  It's actually an
arithmetic for lists, for breaking apart and putting together
lists of things.  So let me show you some list expressions instead of
numerical expressions.
<P>
<I>Car</I> and <I>cdr</I> are the funny names of the operations for
breaking a list into pieces.  These names were chosen for historical
reasons, and no longer make any sense, but everyone knows them.  If
one could start over you'd call car, head or first and you'd call cdr,
tail or rest.  Car returns the first element of a list, and cdr
returns what's left without the first element.  And <I>cons</I> is the
inverse operation, it joins a head to a tail, it adds an element to
the beginning of a list.  Here are some examples, written in
S-expression notation:
<blockquote>
(car (' (a b c))) yields a, <BR>
(cdr (' (a b c))) yields (b c), <BR>
(car (' ((a) (b) (c)))) yields (a), <BR>
(cdr (' ((a) (b) (c)))) yields ((b) (c)), <BR>
(car (' (a))) yields a, <BR>
(cdr (' (a))) yields (), <BR>
(cons (' a) (' (b c))) yields (a b c), <BR>
(cons (' (a)) (' ((b) (c)))) yields ((a) (b) (c)), <BR>
(cons (' a) (' ())) yields (a), <BR>
(cons (' a) nil) yields (a), <BR>
(cons a nil) yields (a).
</blockquote>
Maybe these are easier to understand in M-expression notation:
<blockquote>
car '(a b c) yields a, <BR>
cdr '(a b c) yields (b c), <BR>
car '((a) (b) (c)) yields (a), <BR>
cdr '((a) (b) (c)) yields ((b) (c)), <BR>
car '(a) yields a, <BR>
cdr '(a) yields (), <BR>
cons 'a '(b c) yields (a b c), <BR>
cons '(a) '((b) (c)) yields ((a) (b) (c)), <BR>
cons 'a '() yields (a), <BR>
cons 'a nil yields (a), <BR>
cons a nil yields (a).
</blockquote>
There are some things to explain here.  What is the single quote
function?  Well, it just indicates that its operand is data, not an
expression to be evaluated.  In other words, single quote means
``literally this.''  And you also see that the value of nil is (),
it's a friendlier way to name the empty list.  Also, in the last
example, <I>a</I> isn't quoted, because initially all atoms evaluate
to themselves, are bound to themselves.  Except for nil, which has the
value (), every atom gives itself as its value initially.  This will
change if an atom is used as the parameter of a function and is bound
to the value of an argument of the function.  Numbers though,
<B>always</B> give themselves as value.
<P>
Here are some more examples, this time in M-expression notation.
Note that the operations are done from the inside out.
<blockquote>
car '(1 2 3 4 5) yields 1, <BR>
car cdr '(1 2 3 4 5) yields 2, <BR>
car cdr cdr '(1 2 3 4 5) yields 3, <BR>
car cdr cdr cdr '(1 2 3 4 5) yields 4, <BR>
car cdr cdr cdr cdr '(1 2 3 4 5) yields 5, <BR>
cons 1 cons 2 cons 3 cons 4 cons 5 nil yields (1 2 3 4 5). <BR>
</blockquote>
This is how to get the second, third, fourth and fifth elements of
a list.  These operations are so frequent in LISP that they are
usually abbreviated as cadr, caddr, cadddr, caddddr, etc., and so on
and so forth with all possible combinations of car and cdr.  My LISP
though, only provides the first two of these abbreviations, cadr and
caddr, for the second and third elements of a list.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Conditional expressions: if-then-else, atom, =</H2>
Now I'll give a detailed explanation of
the three-argument function if-then-else that we
used in the definition of factorial.
<blockquote>
(if predicate then-value else-value)
</blockquote>
This is a way to use a logical condition, or predicate, to choose
between two alternative values.  In other words, it's a way to define
a function by cases.  If the predicate is true, then the then-value is
evaluated, and if the predicate is false, then the else-value is
evaluated.  The unselected value is <B>not</B> evaluated.  So
if-then-else and single quote are unusual in that they do not evaluate
all their arguments.  Single quote never evaluates its one argument,
and if-then-else only evaluates two of its three arguments.  So these
are pseudo-functions, they are not really normal functions, even
though they are written the same way that normal functions are.
<P>
And what does one use as a predicate for if-then-else?  Well, for
numerical work one has the numerical comparison operators <, >, <=,
>=, and =. But for work with S-expressions there are just two
predicates, <I>atom</I> and =. Atom returns true or false depending upon
whether its one argument is an atom or not.  = returns true or
false depending upon whether two S-expressions are identical or not.
Here are some examples written in S-expression notation:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(if (= 10 10) abc def) yields abc, <BR>
(if (= 10 20) abc def) yields def, <BR>
(if (atom nil) 777 888) yields 777, <BR>
(if (atom (cons a nil)) 777 888) yields 888, <BR>
(if (= a a) X Y) yields X, <BR>
(if (= a b) X Y) yields Y. 
</blockquote>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Quote, display, eval</H2>
So, to repeat, single quote never evaluates its argument.  
Single quote indicates that its operand is <B>data</B>, not an
expression to be evaluated.  In other words, single quote means
``literally this.'' 
Double
quote is for including S-expressions inside of M-expressions.  Double
quote indicates that parentheses will be given explicitly in this part
of an M-expression.  For example, the M-expressions '+ 10 10 and ' "(+
10 10) and '("+ 10 10) all denote the S-expression (' (+ 10 10)),
which yields value (+ 10 10), <B>not</B> 20.
<P>
<I>Display</I>, which is useful for obtaining intermediate values in
addition to the final value, is just an identity function.  Its value
is the same as the value of its argument, but it has the side-effect
of displaying its argument.  Here is an example written in M-expression
notation:
<blockquote>
car display cdr display cdr display cdr '(1 2 3 4 5) <BR>
displays (2 3 4 5) <BR>
displays (3 4 5) <BR>
displays (4 5) <BR>
and yields value 4.
</blockquote>
<P>
<I>Eval</I> provides a way of doing a <B>stand-alone</B> evaluation
of an expression that one has constructed.  For example:
<blockquote>
eval display cons "^ cons 2 cons 10 nil <BR>
displays (^ 2 10) <BR>
and yields value 1024.
</blockquote>
This works because LISP is interpreted, not compiled.  Instead of
translating a LISP expression into machine language and then running
it, the LISP interpreter is always present doing evaluations and
printing results.  It is very important that the argument of eval is
always evaluated in a clean, initial environment, not in the current
environment.  I.e., the only binding in effect will be that nil is
bound to ().  All other atoms are bound to themselves.  
In other words, the expression being evaled must be self-contained.
This is
important because in this way the result of an eval doesn't depend on
the circumstances when it is used.  It always gives the same value if
it is given the same argument.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Length & size</H2>
Here are two ways to measure how big an S-expression is.
<I>Length</I> returns the number of elements in a list, i.e., at the
top level of an S-expression.  And <I>size</I> gives the number of
characters in an S-expression when it is written in standard notation,
i.e., with exactly one blank separating successive elements of a list.
For example, in M-expression notation:
<blockquote>
length '(a b c) yields 3, <BR>
size '(a b c) yields 7.
</blockquote>
Note that the size of (a b c) is 7, not 8, because when size evaluates 
its argument the single quote disappears.  [If it didn't, its size
would be the size of (' (a b c)), which is 11!]
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Lambda expressions</H2>
Here is how to define a function.
<blockquote>
(lambda (list-of-parameter-names) function-body)
</blockquote>
For example, here is the function that forms a pair in reverse order.
<blockquote>
(lambda (x y) (cons y (cons x nil)))
</blockquote>
Functions can be literally given in place (here I've switched to
M-expression notation):
<blockquote>
('lambda (x y) cons y cons x nil A B) yields (B A)
</blockquote>
Or, if <I>f</I> is bound to the above function definition, then
you can use it like this
<blockquote>
(f A B) yields (B A)
</blockquote>
(The general idea is that the function is always evaluated
before its arguments are, then the parameters are bound to the
argument values, and then the function body is evaluated in this new
environment.) 
How can we bind <I>f</I> to this function definition?  Here's a way that's
permanent.
<blockquote>
define (f x y) cons y cons x nil <BR>
</blockquote>
Then (f A B) yields (B A).   And here's a way that's local.
<blockquote>
('lambda (f) (f A B) 'lambda (x y) cons y cons x nil)
</blockquote>
This yields (B A) too.  If you can understand this example, then you
understand all of my LISP!  It's a list with two elements, the expression
to be evaluated that uses the function, and the function's
definition.  Here's factorial done the same way:
<blockquote>
('lambda (fact) (fact 4) 'lambda (N) if = display N 0 1 * N (fact - N 1))
</blockquote>
This displays 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, and then yields the value 24.  Please try to
understand this final example, because it <B>really</B> shows how my
LISP works!
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Bindings and the environment</H2>
Now let's look at defined (as opposed to primitive) functions more carefully.  To
define a function, one gives a name to the value of each of its
arguments.  These names are called parameters.  And then one indicates
the body of the function, i.e., how to compute the final value.  So
within the scope of a function definition the parameters are bound to
the values of the arguments.
<P>
Here is an example, in which a function returns one of its arguments without
doing anything to it. 
('lambda (x y) x 1 2) yields 1, and ('lambda (x
y) y 1 2) yields 2.  Why?  Because inside the function definition
<I>x</I> is bound to 1 and <I>y</I> is bound to 2.  But all previous
bindings are still in effect except for bindings for <I>x</I> and
<I>y</I>.  And, as I've said before, in the initial, clean environment
every atom except for nil is bound to itself.  Nil is bound to ().
Also, the initial bindings for numbers can never be changed, so that
they are constants.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Let-be-in & define</H2>
Local bindings of functions and variables are so common, that we
introduce an abbreviation for the lambda expressions that achieve
this.  To bind a variable to a value we write:
<blockquote>
(let variable [be] value [in] expression)
</blockquote>
And to bind a function name to its definition we write it like this.
<blockquote>
(let (function-name parameter1 parameter2...) [be]
function-body [in] expression)
</blockquote>
For example (and now I've switched to M-expression notation)
<blockquote>
let x 1 let y 2 + x y  yields 3.
</blockquote>
And
<blockquote>
let (fact N) if = N 0 1 * N (fact - N 1) (fact 4) yields 24.
</blockquote>
<P>
<I>Define</I> actually has two cases like let-be-in, one for defining
variables and another for defining functions:
<blockquote>
(define variable [to be] value)
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
(define (function-name parameter1 parameter2...) [to be] function-body)
</blockquote>
The scope of a define is from the point of definition until the end
of the LISP interpreter run, or until a redefinition occurs.
For example:
<blockquote>
define x 1 <BR>
define y 2 <BR>
Then + x y  yields 3.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
define (fact N) if = N 0 1 * N (fact - N 1) <BR>
Then (fact 4) yields 24.
</blockquote>
Define can only be used at the ``top level.''  You are not allowed
to include a define inside a larger S-expression.  In other words,
define is not really in my LISP.  Actually all bindings are local and
should be done with let-be-in, i.e., with lambda bindings.  Like
M-expressions, define and let-be-in are a convenience for the
programmer, but they're not officially in my LISP, which only allows lambda
expressions and temporary local bindings.  Why?  <B>Because in
theory each LISP expression is supposed to be totally self-contained,
with all the definitions that it needs made locally!</B> Why?  Because
that way the size of the smallest expression that has a given value,
i.e., the LISP program-size complexity, does not depend on the
environment.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Manipulating finite sets in LISP</H2>
Well, that's all of my LISP!  That's all there is!  It's a very simple
language, but a powerful one.  At least for theoretical purposes.
<P>
To illustrate all this, let me show you how to manipulate finite 
sets&mdash;sets, not lists.  We'll define in LISP all the basic set-theoretic
operations on finite sets.  Recall that in a set the order doesn't
count, and no elements can be repeated.
<P>
First let's see how to define the set membership predicate in LISP.
This function, called <I>member?</I>, has two arguments, an
S-expression and a set of S-expressions.  It returns true if the
S-expression is in the set, and false otherwise.
It calls itself again and again, and each time the set, s, is smaller.
<blockquote>
define (member? e s) [is e in s?] <BR>
if atom s false [if s is empty, then e isn't in s] <BR>
if = e car s true [if e is the first element of s, then it's in s] <BR>
(member? e cdr s) [otherwise, look if e is in the rest of s] <BR> <BR>
Then (member? 2 '(1 2 3)) yields true. <BR>
And (member? 4 '(1 2 3)) yields false.
</blockquote>
Let me state this in English.  Membership of <I>e</I> in <I>s</I> is defined as follows.
First of all, if <I>s</I> is empty, then <I>e</I> is not a member of
<I>s</I>.  Second, if <I>e</I> is the first element of <I>s</I>, then
<I>e</I> is a member of <I>s</I>.  Third, if <I>e</I> is not the first
element of <I>s</I>, then <I>e</I> is a member of <I>s</I> iff
<I>e</I> is a member of the rest of <I>s</I>.
<P>
Now here's the intersection of two sets, i.e., the set of all the
elements that they have in common, that are in <B>both</B> sets.
<blockquote>
define (intersection s t) [elements that two sets have in common] <BR>
if atom s nil [if the first set is empty, so is the intersection] <BR>
if (member? car s t) [is the first element of s in t?] <BR>
[if so] cons car s (intersection cdr s t) <BR>
[if not] (intersection cdr s t) <BR> <BR>
Then (intersection '(1 2 3) '(2 3 4)) yields (2 3).
</blockquote>
<P>
Here's the dual of intersection, the
union of two sets, i.e., the set of all the
elements that are in <B>either</B> set.
<blockquote>
define (union s t) [elements in either of two sets] <BR>
if atom s t
[if the first set is empty, then the union is the second set] <BR>
if (member? car s t) [is the first element of s in t?] <BR>
[if so] (union cdr s t) <BR>
[if not] cons car s (union cdr s t) <BR> <BR>
Then (union '(1 2 3) '(2 3 4)) yields (1 2 3 4).
</blockquote>
<P>
Now please do some exercises.  First define the subset predicate,
which checks if one set is contained in another.  Then define the
relative complement of one set <I>s</I> minus a second set <I>t</I>.
That's the set of all the elements of <I>s</I> that are not in <I>t</I>.
Then define <I>unionl</I> which is the union of a list of sets.
Then define the cartesian product of two sets.  That's the set of all
ordered pairs in which the first element is from the first set and the
second element is from the second set.  Finally, define the set of all
subsets of a given set. If a set has <I>N</I> elements, then the set of all its
subsets will have 2<SUP><I>N</I></SUP> elements.
<P>
The answers to these exercises are in the LISP
run in the next section.
But don't look until you try to do them yourself!
<P>
Once you can do these exercises, we're finally ready to <B>use</B>
LISP to prove G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem and Turing's theorem
that the halting problem cannot be solved!  But we'll start <a href=ch3.html>Chapter III</a> by seeing
how to do a <B>fixed point</B> in LISP.  That's a LISP expression that
yields itself as its value!  Can you figure out how to do this before
I explain how?
